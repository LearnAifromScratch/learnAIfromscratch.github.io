I assume you are teaching yourself at the same time some kind of intro course you found on YouTube or a book somebody recommended such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Functional CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/sicp.html">SICP</a></li>
<li>anything</li>
</ul>

<p>
This exists to solve two problems. 
</p>

<p>
The first is finding a job or freelance gig doing $THING you like which <i>seems</i> like it's next to impossible these days. 
</p>

<p>
The second problem is recruiters always ask me where to find candidates for fintech type roles. I pressed them on what exactly they look for in 2024 then found free resources that taught as close to the requirements as possible. Everything here was vetted by them as being desireable as a basic foundation then the character of the candidate is the determining factor not their credentials. What they want is someone with the ability to figure out things themselves, who can program applications requiring high throughput, an in-depth knowledge of at least one language and can describe in detail how it's memory abstraction works to tune or work around it's managed runtime. If you possess the above then you can be taught everything else.  
</p>

<p>
Campus recruiting used to cover this but today is monopolized by big tech corps and government crony contractors that manipulate school guidelines by pressuring students with 2 week expiring offers and paying the school to lock out all competition so it's a struggle to find anyone qualified to do this kind of work. Even if you want nothing to do with fintech we are learning to be apprentice race car engineers but for application development the same skills here translate to anywhere.

There will be much more than this such as software design but here is a brief choose your own adventure.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACO guide</a> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>w/ optional <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-851-advanced-data-structures-spring-2012/pages/assignments/">data structures</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15850/">algorithm design</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6506-s23/">algorithm engineering</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The USACO guide is really good at preparing you for any kind of filtering companies may do through codility or hackerrank and it's completely free unlike leetcode. The graduate design courses are optional if you like getting into the details of the current fastest possible algorithms otherwise nobody will expect you to know this. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A workbook on <a href="https://www.plai.org/">languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Explains that almost all 'industry popular' languages are virtually identical and demystifies all the OOP jargon. It's a workbook we use a web-based <a href="https://github.com/LuKuangChen/stacker-2023">stacker</a> to see exactly how programs work.    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Probability/book.html">Queueing theory</a> and probability models</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you write enough software eventually you discover that almost everything is some kind of queue pattern. This is another workbook that's Q&amp;A style not a giant theory text.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/">Advanced DBMS (OLAP)</a> state of the art analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we learn kernel bypass methods for low latency networking, code profiling and optimization, everything we can about modern distributed application architecture. We can also look at their AI tuning <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/">seminar</a> for dbms optimization knob tuning.

<p>
Find a mentor. There is someone somewhere doing what you want to do and making a lot of money doing it and your task is to do enough material here to reach a level where you can get in with them somehow and absorb everything. Once you are in all you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life. If they get promoted you get promoted. If they go off and found a new company you are the first hire. If they get hired at a top tier trading firm everyone says you have no chance of getting into guess who they will tell the hiring managers they should also hire. 
</p>

<p>
You approach this person and sell yourself telling them you are available if they have some work because you want to learn it all from the ground up. There is always something to do and your goal is to be this magic portal where tedious work they despise doing can be dumped and it returns as per specifications they gave you. If you can do this then there's time for them to show you things. You eventually make your way up to highly sophisticated work until you end up being essential to them where they couldn't imagine going back to working without you because it's a mutually beneficial relationship. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and it worked. In finance this can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you sell yourself to them that you are serious about being mentored they will tell management to make it happen.

<h4 id="orgeb463cf">Make yourself appear employed</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeb463cf">
<p>
Some advice from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40478197">here</a>:
</p>


<p>
"If you can, try to appear employed. For better or worse, people will see you as more desirable if you are employed. This might mean setting up an LLC called Foo Software, giving yourself a role of Software Engineer, and then bidding on projects on Upwork. You don't have to lie about what you are doing if anyone asks (and most won't ask for details), but this gives you something to put on your resume and some experience."

<h4 id="orgb19cd73">Contribute to FSF</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb19cd73">
<p>
You will best be able to pull this off if you actually can commit code somewhere and receive feedback until you become a competent developer people can trust. I recommend only ever contributing to 'free software' as in GNU <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> projects like Blender or the gcc compiler are filled with experts that can mentor you.

<p>
MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. It used to be called 6.170 before MIT renumbered every course recently. Universities always do ridiculous things every 5 years it's like some new dean comes in and demands oh we have to reinvent everything and buy all new (awful) edtech. This is why you should never feel like you don't belong here because they definitely don't and they're being paid outrageous money to screw up everything.  
</p>

<p>
First look at these <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> from 2023 titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i> it briefly explains how you go from brainstorming features of something you want to build into concepts. 
</p>

<p>
Click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. They are all worth watching but we are interested in the two lectures on conceptual design. Watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. Look at the recent <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">slides</a>. You have surely encountered badly designed software and this is a way to model your ideas as state machines then synch them together to compose an application that people can actually understand how to use. 
</p>

<p>
If you don't understand what you just looked at don't worry we'll be implementing it in full you will get it.

<div id="outline-container-orgf3ea9b7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf3ea9b7">Gitless</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3ea9b7">
<p>
Now we are going to take all the above introductions to conceptual design and rewrite the git interface to make it intuitive to use. We have to learn git anyway so may as well write a CLI (command line interface) or you could make it ridiculous and call it 'visual git' or something with DAG graphics.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attatched to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>. Lecture starts ~7m in. So far the data structure and model is trivial to understand if you did any intro course here such as <a href="./accelerated.html">CS19</a> where it's file system assignment was similar. 
</p>

<p>
Proceed to <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> and navigate to research or <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> page on MIT's software design group. You will finds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XZYMjg93o">this</a> talk about the problems with git design. The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills). Watching this talk TODO

In competitive programming you submit source code as a solution to a problem and the online judge compiles and runs your code against tests. There is a huge list of online judges available like Kattis, SPOJ, Timus, Aizu, and more <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/olympiads?lang=cpp">worldwide</a>. 
</p>

<p>
First task is to choose one of these <a href="https://open.kattis.com/languages">languages</a>. We'll learn C++ for USACO so pick something else here that you want to use. List all the problems by <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems?order=difficulty_data">easiest</a> and start with the very first one 'Velkomin!'. You get unlimited submissions to the Kattis judge. 
</p>

<p>
The point of doing this is to learn algorithm design which really is 'system design' there's some complex thing you want to build that needs to be optimized as much as possible and this is how you get better at recognizing patterns and matching them to typical algorithm design strategies.

<h3 id="orga13c0f4">Input/Output</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga13c0f4">
<p>
Read the book or online documemtation of the language you chose or use the USACO <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/input-output">guide</a> first chapter to teach yourself how input/output works in C/C++/Java/Python. There's the USACO <a href="https://ide.usaco.guide/">online IDE</a> too if you want.
</p>

<p>
The problem <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/qaly">qaly</a> is an example of how to take multiple lines of input. Many of these problems the first input will be how much more input to expect which you can then loop on:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int tt;  
    double sum = 0;  
    cin &gt;&gt; tt;   // pipe first stdin to tt
    while (tt--) {  // false when input empty 
        double a, b;  // each loop declare these 2 new assignables
        cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b; // take 2 more inputs
        sum = sum + (a * b);  // accumulator
        }
    cout &lt;&lt; sum;  // pipe sum to stdout
}
</pre>

<p>
Finish up to 1.4 Easy problems on Kattis or until you get how I/O works in your language.

Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later for the ICPC. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like <a href="https://mingw.osdn.io/">MinGW</a> and a <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">file manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem, then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::synch_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, or you can figure out yourself as you go, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing himself examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem writeup. After submission he looks up the solutions and compares them to his own.    
</p>

<p>
A time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names to single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his own laptop, something to remember if debugging and believing your solution still isn't optimized enough, resubmit anyway as you get unlimited submissions.

<h3 id="org25bb540">C++ versions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org25bb540">
<p>
C++ has versions C++98/03/11/14/17/20/23 these all represent years there was a new standard but that doesn't mean everyone implements the entire standard in their compiler. The current state of C++20/23 or 'modern' C++ is you can kind of do functional programming with it. Options, lambdas, higher-order functions, monads and more all now exist in the definition depending which compiler you use. Google has <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/difficulties_improving_cpp.md">rage quit</a> C++ and is writing their own replacement called <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">Carbon</a> and as a result clang/llvm has not even implemented the entire C++20 spec and probably never will which is why you should put efforts into free software compilers and not trust any company. If you want to use C++20/23 in some project you have to use GNU gcc or Microsoft msvc.  
</p>

<p>
Competitive programming typically only accepts C++11/14/17, Python3 and Java and Kotlin unless you do exotic competitive programming like the ICFP. Most of our time in USACO will be creating static arrays and using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">standard template library</a>. The STL to me seems like a big hack to make C++ a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic programming</a> language a concept invented by ML in 1973. If you took the Standard ML course listed in the intro to this workshop then generic programming is simply polymorphism or 'a types. If you took the accelerated intro course then generic programming is the same as 'type variables' in other words a function who's type is determined by whatever parameters you give it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# a generic maximum function of any type T

fun my-max&lt;T&gt;(a :: T, b :: T)-&gt; T:
  if (a &gt; b):
    a
    # if not(a &gt; b) then a == b or a &lt; b   
  else:
    b
  end
where:
  my-max(2, 3) is 3
  # a is unicode 97, b is 98
  my-max("a", "b") is "b"
end
</pre>

<h3 id="orgb42fc0f">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb42fc0f">
<p>
The first resource we can use where 'running time' is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)).
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source code. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life however you will never have infinite inputs so the constant factors do actually matter if they are very large hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are all in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and all his real world testing of graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analaysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constants. 
</p>

<p>
O(g(x)) represents an upper bound for all functions in the family g(x). It doesn't represent growth since f(n) = n<sup>2</sup> does not grow to be quadratic, f() already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. A function n or f(n) is bounded by n, n<sup>2</sup> and n<sup>n</sup> that's why it's <i>an</i> upper bound not <i>the</i> upper bound as there's many upper bounds but you obviously want the closest fitting bound.
</p>

<p>
Big-O is in a hierarchy of asymptotics there's many more like little-o (strictly less than), big-Omega (strictly greater than), or big-Theta \(\theta(n)\) which describes a tight lower and upper bound. For example a program that searches a single list for a specific element is going to be at least a lower bound of O(n) because it has to look at everything once and upper bounded by O(n) so it is \(\theta(n)\).

<h3 id="orgad196fb">Time complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgad196fb">
<p>
Skim through <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze/time-comp">time complexity</a>. Sign up to <a href="https://joincpi.org/video-classes">here</a> where all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEriEvhS48">videos</a> are. Watching the video he explains the 4 suggested resources:
</p>

<p>
First is 'IUSACO' 3-Algorithm Analysis <a href="https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf#page=12">here</a>. It's only chapter 3 and 4 pages long. Explained in the video.
</p>

<p>
Next is 'CPH' 2-Time Complexity <a href="https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=27">here</a> from the competitive programming handbook. This is already known to us from the intro courses so let's look at 2.4 <i>Maximum subarray sum</i>. If it doesn't make sense it means which sequence or combination of neighboring elements produces the greatest sum. Try to solve this yourself before reading their solution. Remember you can prep something with multiple linear consecutive runs since O(n + n) is O(2n) which is of course O(n) and in this problem try removing the negative first and last array element since why would you keep them. The solution they give is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/">Kadane's Algorithm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Next is 'PAPS' 5-Time Complexity <a href="https://usaco.guide/PAPS.pdf#page=99">here</a> and the wall clock (using time() in the shell) is again mentioned but we'll learn you can't rely on wall clock time. Insertion sort we already did in the intro to CS courses where we learned for small data insert can be a constant operation. Page 91 he substituted t<sub>i</sub> for i and since this is a sum where the counter starts at 0, it's going to sum 0 + 1 + 2&#x2026; up to n - 1 times and we already know a sum from 1 to n closed form is (n + 1)n/2 or here (n - 1)n/2 but we can see the dominating power is going to be n<sup>2</sup> and this is followed by an example how n<sup>2</sup> is both an upper bound of n<sup>2</sup> and n. The proof of the bound first he noted that if you multiply N &gt;= 1 you get N<sup>2</sup> &gt;= N and this fact is used in the inequality something we will see in depth later.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUUkiEllHG0">video</a> they suggest goes through how to find function f(x) by analyzing the source. @11:03 remember you multiply everything in the body of a loop by the amount of times you loop. Without doing any of the analysis I can immediately tell this is n * c * n<sup>3</sup> or n<sup>4</sup> 
</p>

TODO&#x2026; try the bronze problems.
