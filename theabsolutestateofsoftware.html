<p>
Here is everything I found that fits together to achieve the goal of being able to follow the <a href="https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/">people</a> who keep winning DEFCON and other CTFs so we can get good enough to eventually be paid to do this being a consultant in the 'security industry' which can be even more sketchy than old school blackhat communities or researching vulns for fun and profit as a side hobby. There is already a hundred other curriculums for this but few that dig into binary exploitation and modern crypto engineering so I put this together and will do all the resources pointing out anything that seems it needs explaining. 
</p>

<p>
I mimic most of the security package at TU/e because all the most critical crypto/sec work is being done in the Netherlands and Germany right now because of insane US laws on crypto software export. There is still an ongoing <a href="https://nist.pqcrypto.org/foia/index.html">lawsuit</a> by Daniel J Bernstein (djb) where the NSA/NIST is slowly delivering FOIA responses about sabotaging crypto development.
</p>

<p>
Everything here is mainly practice with some reading the lectures if available are optional take what you want or start anywhere.

Selling <a href="https://www.crowdfense.com/exploit-acquisition-program/">exploits</a> for a lot of money. Some of these bounties are hilarious like only 100k for code signing bypass, it must be easier than it looks if it pays lower than a Wordpress exploit. They also really want a Docker escape vuln. <a href="https://zerodium.com/">Zerodium</a> is another claiming to pay market value for exploits. The way this works is they pay you over time not all at once that way you can't turn around and sell it again and a patch appears.
</p>

<p>
If you can do this typically you will want to work for <a href="https://dfsec.com/">dfsec</a> they pay you for research and a bonus for any major bug you find. It used to be you could just extract control-flow graphs and run a logical assistant on it finding any kind of potential attack vulns then take a month to write a full proof of exploit for it but I have no idea what they do these days but we'll find out as we go.

<h4 id="org860b01a">SOC threat analyst</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org860b01a">
<p>
SOC means Security Operations Center. This is a wagie working shifts for a 24/7 (usually remotely) enterprise tier threat response contractor who is paid to anaylze system logs (almost always Windows OS logs) and analyze network traffic to spot problems. They have some kind of monitoring tools and you primarily extract and filter data with OSquery and do 'threat intelligence'. The curriculum we are already doing is more than enough to get into this or find some kind of learning path for SOC Level 1 and 2 but these almost always cost money. This is the only <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/cybersecurity/ibm-threat-intelligence-lifecycle-fundamentals">free course</a> (edx) I could find. This <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1">one</a> is the cheapest I could find it appears to be some subscription model of $14/m or you could simply use their syllabus to look up everything yourself like OSquery, wireshark, Snort, MITRE etc. Most people get into this via the military or were former system admins or pay for <a href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc">certs</a>. 
</p>

<p>
To find SOCs search for security operations center jobs or try Sophos or NCC Group (Netherlands or Philippines) these companies have to hire local citizens and can't outsource because of security clearances. I imagine these outfits exist so gov contractors and giant medical companies can satisfy some kind of insurance compliance or lawsuit protection from any breaches/leaked data. If you get in here you want to move up to running the place because they pay for all your silly certs and because every tech company will hire you as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) should you leave SOC work. Outside of finance and pharma/medical the CISO is usually given next to no budget and no authority you get paid a lot of money to sit on the executive board while answering emails and making presentations it's a ceremonial job almost where you hire the same SOC you used to work for and then play golf or whatever CISO's actually do all day.

Someone charging 7-20k+ per week for an application security assessment. This kind of person can do the 'full stack' of security review from source code review/dependencies to secOps deployment to how developers handle the keys for signing into the source repository. With large security consulting outfits the typical engagement is 2-3 consultants for 2 weeks where there is juniors competent in running security procedures like penetration testing and the principal consultant oversees them and presents all the reports the juniors produced justifying the money spent. On large contracts they will outsource reverse engineers and all kinds of other specialists charging insanely high hourly rates. The major outfits are Leviathan security, IOactive, Bishop Fox, NCC group, Crowdstrike, or search for security consultant jobs. Leviathan is probably the biggest in the US because I believe you have to contract either them and/or Bishop Fox in order use any kind of Google auth in your software. They even sell a 'virtual CISO' <a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/services/risk-advisory-services/virtual-chief-information-security-officer">service</a>. If these outfits aren't hiring send in a general application or email them and say you want to apprentice showing them some kind of proof of your skills like custom tools you wrote or something.

Immediately npm breaches is brought up, the JavaScript package manager. If you've ever installed some Node.js software to run it locally you will have noticed there's hundreds of dependencies being automatically installed. If you missed the attack description the stream dependency was attacked to specifically target some Bitcoin wallet software in hopes that the wallet developers themselves would include it in their builds and they did. All the attacker had to do was find some unmaintained but popular dependency and took over the entire project. Many browser plugins have had this happen too, either sold to adtech or malware writers or they helpfully take over the abandoned project. 
</p>

<p>
@9:00 we're getting into nightmare scenario where VSCode the IDE most developers use is now compromised. The point is some dependency nobody pays attention to got turned into malicious code and found it's way into almost every critical program on earth.
</p>

<p>
@19:50 the seemingly benign software you find in the wild like adding colors to your terminal or javascript console is actually filled with malware of course but you probably knew that already. Famously this was almost all the flashlight/torch apps on app store before they cracked down.

He talks about SELinux also known as MAC or mandatory access controls like AppArmor. MAC is something enterprise security people love because it's knob tweaking but state can become so complex in modern systems you cannot guarantee your policy doesn't allow illicit states without some kind of logical assistant to model everything and run tests on. Whenever you search for AppArmor or SELinux the number one recommendation or most-searched for query is <i>how to turn it off</i> because it's intefering in someone's work and in the real world that's what everyone does.

Now cancelled former Tor developer and 'Wikileaks associate' Jacob Appelbaum quietly got a PhD from two of the world's premiere crypto experts DJ Bernstein and Tanja Lange at TU/e in the Netherlands. I don't know or care about any of the details of his fall from grace but he did write a thesis/dissertation so we may as well read it. The pdf is <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/communication-in-a-world-of-pervasive-surveillance-sources-and-me">here</a> or direct link <a href="https://research.tue.nl/files/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Skimming the intro this is more of a political manifesto instead of a thesis I'm surprised the school didn't demand he remove a lot of cringe here. In the section he calls bad mathematics he shames on cruise control others who take fed cash yet seems completely unaware he once worked for the Tor Project which is funded by US <a href="https://support.torproject.org/misc/misc-3/">federal agencies</a> like the DoD. If you follow DJ Bernstein then you know he amusingly rants on the IETF crypto working group mailing list whenever some stooge proposes yet another badly designed or patent trolled elliptic curve scheme so that to me is the definition of 'bad mathematics' trying to sneak in broken by design protocols. In 1.2 <i>Thinking about the future</i> some of the claims derived from the questionable sources he lists are so wild even Wikipedia jannies wouldn't have green lighted this so I skipped most of it but the theme as far I can tell is crypto still works if it's designed/used correctly. 
</p>

<p>
Section 2 <i>Background on network protocols</i> skimming this quickly OpenVPN is demonized as being the target of NSA weakening but OpenVPN code is so ridiculously bad and convoluted that they probably didn't really have to do anything nefarious to it except promote it's use. 
</p>

<p>
Section 3 <i>Background on cryptography</i> if you look at Tanja Lange's <a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/tanja/teaching/pqcrypto22/">crypto course</a> page she recommends for general background this free online <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">book</a> so we can refer to it as we very lightly read this section. The <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf">hash functions</a> chapter a hash function h maps bit-strings of arbitrary but finite length to strings of fixed length so the domain of the function (inputs) maps to a range (outputs) that is many-to-one as the inputs are larger than the range so there exists the possibility of collisions where 2 distinct pairs of inputs have the same output. Now you know how password hashing works, the hashes map to a plain text input but the Appelbaum thesis notes these password hash functions are designed to be extremely slow by purposely running inefficient calculations that require large amounts of contiguous memory so you can't easily brute force the hash by bombing it with millions of strings to guess passwords. 
</p>

<p>
Block ciphers <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap7.pdf">chapter</a> seems to be a function that accepts as input a n-bit sized vector of plaintext and a key vector then a product transformation occurs to create ciphertext that is the same size of the input. If the input exceeds the size of the n-bit block then it's partitioned into same size blocks and encrypted seperately using a mode of operation to do so one old example is ECB or electronic-codebook mode. A symmetric key is shared via some Diffie-Hellman like public key system we can learn later. The term 'nonce bit' is called IV or initialization vector in older books. Djb's ChaCha20 high speed crypto and Poly1305 MAC is mentioned and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539">detailed here</a> if interested. Skimming the rest of this chapter there's an interesting comment about NIKE or non-interactive key exchange that has a deniability property where finding encrypted content that decrypts with someone else's key is still not definitive proof of any communication between each other. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 4 you probably already know most of this if you read the Snowden leaks and 2017 Wikileaks CIA files and there's a bunch of material here in this chapter on glowie PSYOPS strategies all laid out in chronological order. Applebaum goes totally off the rails again back into political manifesto territory. A lot of content is straight up ranting but the later content going through all known shady nation state malware and explaining how it works is worth reading. Even though a lot of these exploit 'products' in the leaked ANT catalog are from 10 years ago I doubt much has changed especially what data they were after so the methods change but the target is the same. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 5 GNU naming system has a good crash course on how DNS works. The NSA shenanigans detailed here are amusing they ran some global monitoring bot network to hide their DNS queries after an attack to admire their work and avoid blame. GNS is a <a href="https://docs.gnunet.org/latest/users/gns.html">GNUnet</a> app which I like way more than all the blockchain nonsense going on right now requiring massive amounts of mining. Note to self look into GNUnet more.   
</p>

<p>
Chapter 6 WireGuard tweak it only works for some future quantum adversary meaning if traffic is vacuumed up and held to be broken years later then this tweak works otherwise an active quantum adversary you have to redesign the entire WireGuard protocol. That's if quantum computers aren't a total scam every company in the field always makes suspect promises of massive amounts of qbits then nothing happens. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 7 Vula has code to read <a href="https://vula.link/">here</a> and is developed anonymously obviously because of Appelbaum's pariah status. I'll have to come back here after we get familiar with post quantum crypto an automatic LAN encrypting scheme is a pretty awesome idea.

In the early days you basically stumbled into hacking by accident you either pressed a combo of commands and accidentally gained complete control over the system or you traded techniques with other hackers for personal curiosity or fun there was no kind of security industry for software or even much criminal activity until the hacker crackdown. 
</p>

<p>
Then post-Mitnic in the late 90s to mid 2000s there was a blackhat culture where cracking copyright protections and releasing pirate software (warez scene) took over spawning a binary exploitation/reverse engineering and remote box popping hacking culture that still exchanged ideas and software for free but quickly a marketplace emerged for selling vulns for the purposes of jacking financial data and 0day auctions started springing up in the underground. 
</p>

<p>
That scene completely died and was replaced by nation states and corporations vying for global dominance of security which we just read about in Appelbaum's thesis. Real hacking is now a job it's no longer the fun pursuit it was in the past now everything is way too serious and way too much money involved.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Huntley_Watt">Stephen Huntley Watt</a> is the only convicted blackhat who never snitched. 
</p>

<p>
He was one of the most famous blackhats of the 2000s because of PR0J3KT M4YH3M a war against the whole so-called white hat industry. There was an anti-sec movement back then claiming that disclosure sites like bugtraq, security conferences and anti-virus corporations were creating the problem they were paid to solve by dumping what is essentially nuclear weapons to masses of global criminals free of charge. A classic method back then was to simply run a diff on whatever bugtraq or other disclosed patch to reveal the exploit then write up a turn-key h4xxoring product and sell it on skiddy forums as it would take months or sometimes years for people to update their systems so unpatched systems were wide open. "Better hire us to protect you" these outfits would claim while at the same time creating chaos by arming everyone on earth. 
</p>

<p>
A lot of project mayhem is detailed in ~el8 <a href="http://web.textfiles.com/ezines/EL8/">text files</a> from 2001-2002 where they attacked every known white hat and somehow avoided prison. They even super trolled Theo De Raadt who is also known (back then) as one of the most trollastic open source devs but today I am thankful OpenBSD still exists it's a nice clean OS where you can understand everything that is going on.
</p>

<p>
He was making a nice salary in NYC as a trading systems software developer (at now called <a href="https://tsimagine.com/">tsImagine</a>) and gave away for free a packet sniffing program to a fellow blackhat he knew since high school who was then involved in stupid financial criminal activity and snitched on him. He claimed on is Xwitter the only way he could get a job despite being one of the best hackers on earth was to apply to a Ukraine company after prison and if you search around they are desperate for foreign remote devs in Kiev because of the war. Last I heard he still owes the US gov $170m+ and works for DomainTools as a principle software engineer.

</div>

<p>
The courts declared Max a 'super hacker' who was so good the judge at his trial called him 'the hacker of all hackers' and gave him way less time than normal out of pure shock for his skill. There's an entire book about this guy worth reading because he took over the entire underground market in a single night breaking into the 4 biggest competitor markets and stealing their databases of users, emailing all users that they should join his site instead and shutting his competition down. Some of these sites touted their uber security like requiring a special signed cert handed out only to a few people to even connect to the server and of course he got those certs and broke in. His demise began when one of the sites he usurped was a federal sting site and the feds weren't too happy about him taking it over. 
</p>

<p>
Max although released now on parole is still facing new charges claiming he used a phone at the prison to 'control drones and drop contraband in the prison' which is of course likely nonsense. Personal experience tells me there was probably some guy there who pestered Max to tell him how to do whatever he was doing while they were playing cards then when he got caught he of course snitched on the bigger fish like all these guys do. 
</p>

<p>
Max used a lot of tricks like hiding his very popular marketplace in plain site so sysadmins or feds couldn't find him. I'll write about this later but I suspect he modified protocols so any kind of scanning would render his market invisible as the scans didn't know what to look for. A classic example is changing the rounds in ssh thus creating a stealth handshake you can probe all you want but if your probe doesn't speak the same protocol how would it handshake and find what it's looking for? He then could camoflauge the traffic as normal network traffic.

There is a man called ASTRA who was revealed to be a 58 year old retired mathematician living in Greece. He remotely broke into France's Dassault corporation which manufactures military aircraft and weapons and sold secrets worth 350 million dollars from 2002 until 2008 to their competitors worldwide with the help of a global hacker network. He was clearly not an employee leaking information or anything or else he'd be in prison and his identity revealed. Nobody has ever revealed his identity because he likely was hacking OpenSSL or has other mad crypto skills they deemed too important to not know about so hired him quietly for security advice. He was living under <i>perfectly forged</i> identities in Athens that he had hacked (again this is prob OpenSSL or other crypto hacking breaking into gov dbms) and they never revealed how they caught him though likely it was following money or a lesser guy in his network was picked up and snitched. Even though he had a sophisticated network of criminals to help him pick up wire xfers from around the world it was only a matter of time as memecoins like Zcash (nobody uses the full anonymizing features) or Monero (don't trust, questionable math assumptions in the protocol proof) didn't exist then.

Let's watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01oeaBb85Xc">this</a> DEFCON 30 talk from last year about a guy involved in shady stuff. I have some experience in this so will add annoying commentary but I was never using these sites to sell or buy I was interested in custom software buildilng and they would always make me an internal member with access to private messaging groups just because I'm good at <a href="http://www.infiltration.org/zine.html">infiltration</a>. This talk is about 'keeping safe from the federal gov' but in reality you can't as we'll see.
</p>

<p>
First of all the bearded introduction guy looks exactly like the bearded talk giving guy wtf. I don't recognize his aliases from back in the day (Ulbricht market, all the clones after, the earlier markets like Rave Supply/Adams Flowers or the Russian market that did dead drops that disappeared). There is def some ppl I remember from those days like one moderator guy who was often hilarious and had a confused looking John C Reilly avatar who got away scott free through pure stupidity. They revealed in court docs they had set up a fed sting for him twice on a famous market you know about to pick up money they sent to him from a compromised admin account but he was so incompetent he went to the wrong address both times. He's living free right now somewhere I always think how lucky that guy is they had set up a massive sting with multiple agencies and he escaped because he was too stoned to know what was going on.  
</p>

<p>
He talks about shipping narcotics in the mail and how you could get enhanced charges. Bruce Schneier has a good article about crime how that criminals never use probability to estimate the cost of their actions or if the crime they're about to do is worth betting on. In finance you are always estimating the expected value of some game strategy and deciding if it's worth the risk. 
</p>

<p>
The pros of narcotics mail shipping was a site called Adam's Flowers in the Netherlands who shipped globally for like a decade before they changed to Tor in 2005 and became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer%27s_Market">The Farmers Market</a>. Of course I was in there too after I infiltrated as a junior software dev just to see how the inner workings went on I never really cared about drugs or did them after high school. They would take an iron and roll hash so flat it was almost paper thin then use a clever vacuum sealing method I can't remember that was similar to how you open an air sealed video card in this metal bag. They would wrap this in some papers and send it as a normal letter without tracking and it was totally and completely indistinguishable from regular mail no thickness at all though if they xray now it would obviously be caught. The guy running that was busted because of Hushmail much like how old blackberry phones used to be sold with 'unbreakable encryption' but you could easily compromise the server and get all the keys. 
</p>

<p>
@7:32 in this video it's hilarious he used the sex offender registry to find return addresses for his shipments but you would always want to use random abandoned properties so it goes to the undeliverable mail office to be destroyed and never opened.
</p>

<p>
@15:50 is the fallacy 'how they screwed up'. If you read anything here you realize that it's impossible not to screw up unless you live in a country with non-extradition and you have political cover. If you don't have political cover then these foreign nations phone your local police dept about you and they arrive to shake you down for money. 
</p>

<p>
@19m some good advice here but again using whatever meme OS like Whonix is not your most critical attack vector it's people you know in real life or trying to cash out money.  
</p>

<p>
@22m Max Vision also had a safe house and never used his location to do stuff but they simply followed him after one of his IRL associates snitched. @26:49 the guy from lulzsec was busted after he got wasted and signed in accidentally under a watched nym to some chat channel without using his normal protections. What was critical about that is they already knew who he was through means not disclosed and were watching him from a parking lot when he handed over a fool proof warrant for his apartment by logging in with his home ISP address. 
</p>

<p>
@29m do not trust XMR and we'll learn why later, no memecoin can be trusted. This is the problem with this kind of activity is you can't really convert it to pay yourself on the scale of activities like trafficking. I'm sure you can think of ways like being a XMR seller 'but i'm only selling coins honestly I've done nothing wrong' and no you're now doing wire fraud and intl crime with insane penalties. People also don't know when you use certain currencies their national bank controls it so now you are under their jurisdiction because the txn will have occured in some bank offshore so even if you're some Euro guy selling only in Europe if you convert to certain currencies you're now on the hook even if it was some kind of momentary change in a crypto exchange from selling XMR to USD then withdrawing in Euros. Everything you can think of to avoid detection someone already tried it's very important if you're involved in this kind of activity to realize there is no such thing as original ideas how to launder money that's why extensive crime networks are typically used. 
</p>

<p>
@33m he redpills that all the message forum style lawyers are wrong because the feds simply lie to someone you know that they are going to jail forever unless they talk and they will always without exception snitch and you're done. They don't even need to have witnessed a crime just confirm certain movements and in court they present this as proof of furtherence of a conspiracy. No amount of arguing 'but but but Franks hearing' or 'this is against the constitution!' argument will ever matter in court because they just need a single snitch. If you are foreign its even worse you get no such hearings anyway and are even punished for resisting extradition with the threat of increased time. 
</p>

End of this he warns it's a bad business model doing what he did and the return on investment is never enough for the risk. Exactly what Bruce Schneier used to warn that criminals never do a risk assessment or calculate the probabilities of their actions succeeding and end up paying vastly more than what the crime paid. That said let's move on to hack the gibson for fun and profit.

<h3 id="org9391754">The gist of this course</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9391754">
<p>
I actually took this course with recorded lectures a decade ago before CMU deleted them. All the content is in the notes/slides and labs the lectures that I saw were mainly <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/">Rob J Simmons</a> trying to get students to stop using <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?OperationalReasoning">operational reasoning</a>. He would put up code in the slides and then try and get them to think why this has a bug. Most of the lectures that I remember it was extremely difficult to 'prove' any imperative code was correct there was always just one more bug to find. 
</p>

<p>
We are taking this course here because it's a good prereq for 15-213 and because we want to know all the undefined behavior of C so we can exploit it later. We also want to know how to think about programs without using operational reasoning. I assume you have taken a basic intro course to programming either from <a href="./index.html">here</a> or watched YouTube videos, or read some Zed Shaw tutorials, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
We are also taking this course because it will cover any kind of 'white board' interview you may run into seeking employment in this field though usually they never drill security consultants on how a graph works (it's just linear algebra change of basis) or hash functions it will be yet another tool you have ready to pull out.

<h3 id="org9d64fba">Setup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9d64fba">
<p>
First let's get c0 programming language (pronounced c-naught or c-not) by installing it <a href="https://bitbucket.org/c0-lang/docs/wiki/Downloads">here</a>. Use can use any text editor, you either compile a c0 program to a binary and run it or you use coin interpreter see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Are6AK5Nn4">setup video</a> and skip to @8m 'Running a c0 program'. You can also use various editor plugins. If you use VScode it's in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=15122staff.c0-lsp">marketplace</a> if you use emacs like me they have a c0-mode but I'm just going to manually run everything mostly in coin.
</p>

<p>
The first lecture if you downloaded everything contains mystery2.c0
</p>

<pre class="example">
/* Mystery function with a bug or two
 *
 * 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation
 * Frank Pfenning
 */

int f (int x, int y) {
  int r = 1;
  while (y &gt; 1) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      r = x * r;
    }
    x = x * x;
    y = y / 2;
  }
  return r * x;
}
</pre>

<p>
Type 'coin mystery2.co' and you get the c0 interpreter. Inside the interpreter enter f(3,2); (note the semicolon) and press return to see it evaluated. To exit Ctrl-D which is the universal exit command for any Unix/Linux shell program meaning 'end of input' or type #quit. This is all in their <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s15/lab/lab0.pdf">setup lab</a> or the video I posted above. The c0.typesafety.net domain is long gone.

<p>
The first <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s15/lec/02-contracts.pdf">lecture</a>. Like we did in setup paste that mystery program to test.c0 and load it in coin and try it out with inputs.

There is a problem with the book where the global version the publisher paid someone to screw with the practice problems and many of the solutions in the book are wrong. The only decent pdf you can find is the global version too I don't think they have a US electronic version. I bought the global version for I think $20 and the actual chapter contents are identical it's only many of the early exercises I find that were bungled. You can use library genesis to get an OCR'd copy but they are all gigantic in size see this <a href="http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=A665E0B6F83F9FE49120BE27F3A85902">upload</a> where the Chinese uploader describes all the versions available. However does it really matter? If there's a practice problem translating C to assembly we can always generate the unoptimized assembly with the compiler and verify it ourselves or figure out easily any hex to binary solution.

<h3 id="org97478eb">Lecture 2</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org97478eb">
<p>
Watching the <a href="https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6ca8cdb4-6961-42d9-8fac-299e53759a17">second lecture</a> since the first is just logistics for the course. The lectures are definitely helpful for this course because the book is filled with so many details you can easily get lost. 
</p>

<p>
The boolean algebra slide @9:32 consider watching some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfAKsZOWBVg">this</a> if you have time we are dealing with a vector space or binary 'field' of mod2 arithmetic where A and B is multiplication, A xor B is addition (mod2). In compsci courses they never really explain these and finite fields will come up when we do cryptography. They definitely don't explain that Aristotle's logic was encoded by Boole.
