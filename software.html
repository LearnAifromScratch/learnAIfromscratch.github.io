<h3 id="orga033d5e">Fintech recruiting in 2024</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga033d5e">
<p>
I often meet up with software <a href="https://joveinternational.com/markets-coverage/">recruiters</a> in finance who tell me a tale of woe how much harder it's become to find candidates. I asked them what exactly do you want these days for basic new grad style candidates and would you look at resumes without a degree. The following curriculum is a result of these conversations which are ongoing as I've been toying with the idea <i>can I teach someone to do what we do here from scratch</i> so they don't have to spend $90k or w/e the total cost is now for undergrad at a university. I have no intention of creating a new filter or mandatory hoop people must jump through this is simply a collection of free materials to optionally take if you don't have a degree.   
</p>

<p>
The recruiters told me if they could find a non-degree candidate that knows the entire CPU-arch execution pipeline and can answer any question about how an eviction from the cache might happen (like a hash collision) then they get a point. If they know a language and can explain how it works precisely including it's managed runtime if it has one then that's another point. If they have provable problem solving skills typically taught by competitive programming where given a seemingly impossible problem the candidate can at least work to a non-optimized solution without immediately giving up then that's another point. Finally if they can do all of the above with a very high standard of code quality then that is the perfect introductory candidate who can be taught anything else needed.
</p>

<p>
There's many reasons why you'd want to work for <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisaycock/8b7a37b1f97549517cb7789be5b06266">trading firms</a>. Valkyrie in Chicago will hire <a href="https://www.valkyrietrading.com/careers/junior-software-engineer/">juniors</a> for example but the rest will as well if you know the material here. My reasons are paid education. You get paid to go from technician to the Formula 1 race car engineer of software development.

<h3 id="org5c73bdc">The work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c73bdc">
<p>
Everything is bespoke from the server metal up where you are expected to know or quickly learn everything about L1/L2 cache and Intel features like Intel RDT (CAT,CMT) or Processor Trace. Not all the work is pure optimization these big funds now have large suites of custom client software and even roll their own internal email, code review software, even the compiler is completely custom where I work. You typically start out working on customer trading software or at the beginning of the critical path where hundreds of paid data feeds are coming in as a massive end of trading day dump or coming in continuously that have to be parsed in the most efficient possible strategy. One example is those 'no fee trading' middle-man brokerages like Robinhood they are likely selling their entire order book to a major HFT firm meaning someone had to write the infrastructure for that order book to be parsed, be fed into a trading optimizer to find the lowest fee buy strategy then sell it back to Robinhood within microseconds. You are trained how to do this of course which is why selection is so competitive they need developers who can learn.

<p>
Jove Intl, <a href="https://oxfordknight.co.uk/jobs/">Oxford Knight</a>, Reload Search, and ex-employees who have quit to become highly paid one-man recruiting shops most of whom are the one's I've been talking to after running into them at bars after work and at events.

<h3 id="orgf7755ad">Selection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf7755ad">
<p>
They told me they go over all resumes, there's no automated ATS or applicant tracking system. USACO training stands out, so-called modern C++ meaning C++17/20/23 stands out but is not necessary as they will train you. You never sell yourself as a junior, companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed writing software even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer on Upwork actively looking for contract work. Candidates are sometimes ranked, so you have to be better than everyone else who would automatically rank higher (degrees, work experience) which is possible through sheer determination because the hiring pool for entry level candidates who can both pass the interviews and are willing to stay on and become senior is very limited right now. Referals do exist but have consequences meaning you are personally vouching for someone so nobody is going to hand out a referral to a stranger online.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf59b36b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf59b36b">Campus recruiting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf59b36b">
<p>
Getting more and more monopolized by big tech and big gov contractors that manipulate school guidelines by pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) so it is a struggle to find any of the good grads to do this kind of work. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies further draining the hiring and internship pool. The available roles seem like they pay less than big tech when you forget you can invest your bonus in the high-yield investment fund too so that's another reason many new grads don't apply. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb8bac57" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb8bac57">Phone screens</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8bac57">
<p>
I don't know if they still do this but one Chicago company was notorious for firing off 3 problems to solve on Hackerrank seconds after you submitted an application. The phone screen is usually a recruiter asking are you legal to work and if not what credentials do you have because in some countries like the US you will need a reason for them to issue you a work visa for a job that can't be given to a local so a degree or equivalent work experience. They will of course dodge salary questions with the tried and true 'well I hire for x amount of countries so don't have that exact information right now' but in my experience they offer a range at least.   
</p>

<p>
If you have been vouched for, which is very common in the finance world, then you skip the second phone interview and come in for a casual meeting usually about whatever you previously built and they may ask you about details of the language you claim to be an expert in. Any jargon you use they will ask you to define on the spot to catch you bluffing. If for whatever reasons you're asked to write software it will be to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> which is the new fizzbuzz filter everyone has adopted and tests how careless of a developer you are meaning you don't ask any questions about requirements and start writing code immediately. We were told if we were to personally vouch and refer candidates for an interview then our friends we vouched for could expect the above. There's of a course a catch, if we refer someone and they fail miserably meaning we are careless with referals, then we have to cover the cost of the interview which is thousands of dollars so you won't find anyone handing out referals to people they don't know. 
</p>

<p>
If not vouched for expect the second zoom/phone call to be a typical algorithm style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg">interview</a>. Code correctness and caution is heavily favored over adding complexity to squeeze out some meaningless optimization of constant factors. As a personal anecdote these interview tasks are often designed as a trap to once again see how careless of a developer you are the problems I've seen have an obvious area of optimization to take that will open a performance sink elsewhere if you aren't taking your time thinking through the whole original problem space. Prime example they will try and get you with is <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/">cache invalidation</a>. If they're still interested you'll be paid to come out for on-site 'culture fit' job shadowing and sometimes multiple more rounds of interviews but it depends on the country in Hong Kong I had a brief on-site meeting immediately followed by an employment contract offer. Hiring someone is an investment it will typically take 3 months for them to be productive and if you're being paid $200k/yr that's $50k they have spent hoping you will turn out to be a good hire so now you know why there is all these hoops to jump through.

<div id="outline-container-org1fee85e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1fee85e">Find a mentor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1fee85e">
<p>
Once you are in and develop a routine walk over to the department where all the money is being made and find a mentor to teach you by asking them to give you the work they don't like doing because you want to learn it all from scratch. All you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually want you to work with them once you have proven to be indispensible and insist you be transferred internally where you will double your salary. If they get promoted you get promoted, if they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you are serious about wanting to learn they will tell management to make it happen. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and my life would not be the same if I hadn't watched that throwaway clip at 3am because I always assumed there was no way I could ever do this kind of work.
</p>

<p>
If you're not interested in finance there are a few companies that mentor developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and build them to senior developers. One is in New Hampshire called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer. LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> I've only ever used it to harvest recruiter offers. Of course not all fintech outfits are worth working at, do your own research on what kind of NDAs they may make you sign though the video game industry does the same anti-competitor working clause in all their employment contracts and everyone ignores them unless you make your own competing company then expect to be sued.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and the professor of that course wrote a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. The first thing we will use this course for is to make a static site for ourselves which will be our business card we hand out as freelancers. Since we don't have tons of work experience or credentials keep it as minimalist as possible while showing off skills we will develop from this course. See the recitation slides for <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/recitation-notes/R1_slides.pdf">VitePress</a> which we'll go through completely after learning git.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This has <a href="https://www.strml.net/">potential</a> but intro before 'live coding' too long</li>
<li><a href="https://jasonpien.com/">Student</a> example though again intro should be cut</li>

<li><a href="https://kru.run/win/98">Win98</a> example</li>
</ul>

<p>
First look at these <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> from 2023 titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i>. Page 8 click on his riffle.systems idea where a 'reactive database' is used to declaratively write entire websites even generating the html elements thus totally replacing how modern webdev is done because really all a web framework does is handle changing state and we've already learned how to best control state it's called a database management system. You can build a prototype of this yourself if interested after we take the advanced database content later in this workshop.
</p>

<p>
Concepts are introduced, see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOhtH3lugk&amp;list=PLY_nsiUEgM3nbxcO3_ONmKL-ZRhLKpfGV">YouTube video</a> from an AI talk at MIT where the professor of this course further explains what a concept is and how you would use them to get an LLM to develop an entire web app. Note that in their experiment they had to use 'a few hundred' prompts which then becomes your version history and I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to refactor a few hundred prompts but they made it easier with concepts. tl;dr AI will not be replacing webdev anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
To watch more about concepts click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. Watch the two lectures on concepts: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. Look at the recent <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">slides</a>. You have surely encountered badly designed software and this is a way to model your ideas as state machines then synch them together to compose an application that people can actually understand how to use. If you don't understand what you just looked at don't worry we'll be implementing it in full you will get it.

We'll come back to this course after we learn git. There's a <a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop/">GUI</a> for git you don't have to use the command line interface.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>. Lecture starts ~7m in. So far the data structure and model is trivial to understand if you did any intro course here such as <a href="./accelerated.html">CS19</a> learnings about DAGs.

<p>
Proceed to <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> and navigate to research or <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> page on MIT's software design group. You will find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XZYMjg93o">this</a> talk about the problems with git design. The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills).

<h2 id="orgac2ed6b">USACO</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgac2ed6b">
<p>
I'm going to do all the USACO contest problems using inquiry-based learning because that's exactly what you do in real life. If you took <a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a> you have already seen almost every topic in the USACO guide and if you didn't it doesn't matter that's why there exists a guide which we can look at while we solve a problem, so you learn the algorithm as you are using it. 
</p>


<p>
<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember.

<div id="outline-container-org3092843" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3092843">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3092843">
<p>
The USACO guide has a good introduction to big-O and a resource we can use where running time is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

<h3 id="orga0eaee5">Problem complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0eaee5">
<p>
Before we start trying to solve problems watch <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/lectures/L01.html">this</a> Erik Demaine lecture and skip to 09:00. We want to know what polynomial time is, what NP means, what satisfiability means and this is a good enough ~30m crash course in complexity as these concepts come up all the time in algorithm literature. He tells us most decision problems can't be solved by an algorithm which ruins the AI superintelligence dystopia. When he translates Super Mario Bros to a 3SAT decision problem we can see that almost every algorithm you can think of can be transformed to a decision problem. You don't have to keep watching this but there's an interesting intro to constraint logic/graphs. Now you can explain to someone P=NP means all the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms that always 'lucky guess' correctly or have a magic oracle can be solved by an algorithm in deterministic polynomial time which seems impossible. 
</p>

<p>
The rest of this course I won't do here but the book he wrote that goes with the lectures looks excellent covering topics in economics too.

If you look at the archived <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results">contests</a> we are given all the test inputs/outputs as a .zip and a fully worked out solution with a proof of the bounds. This means <i>you can use any language you want</i> however I am going to do it all in C++ with Knuth's literate programming tool cweb because it mimics exactly how you would build something in a collaborative setting and after using it for a few problems it's kind of awesome and I finally get why Knuth shills this style of programming so much.
