<h4 id="org861bac8">Finance jobs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org861bac8">
<p>
I often meet up with software <a href="https://joveinternational.com/markets-coverage/">recruiters</a> in finance who tell me a tale of woe how much harder it's become to find candidates so I asked them what exactly do you want these days for a basic new grad style candidate and would they look at resumes without a degree. The following curriculum is a result of these conversations which are ongoing as I've been toying with the idea <i>can I teach someone to do what we do here from scratch</i> so they don't have to spend $90k or whatever the total cost is now for an undergrad at even a public university. I have no intention of creating a new filter or mandatory hoop people must jump through this is simply a collection of free materials to optionally take if you don't have a degree.    
</p>

<p>
The recruiters told me if they could find a non-degree candidate that knows the entire CPU-arch execution pipeline and can answer any question about how an eviction from the cache might happen (like mutating state/hash collision) then they get a point. If they know a language extremely well like they've been using it everyday and can explain how it abstracts the memory including it's managed runtime if it has one then that's another point. If they have provable problem solving skills typically taught by competitive programming where given a seemingly impossible problem the candidate can at least work to a non-optimized solution without immediately giving up then that's another point. Finally if they can do all of the above with a very high standard of code quality then that is the perfect introductory candidate who can be taught anything else needed and they should be contacting recruiters asap. All of the above is not impossible to teach yourself so I will do just that here to prove it can be done. 
</p>

<p>
There's many reasons why you'd want to work for <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisaycock/8b7a37b1f97549517cb7789be5b06266">trading firms</a>. Most of them are in Chicago and trading firms like Valkyrie will hire <a href="https://www.valkyrietrading.com/careers/junior-software-engineer/">juniors</a> explicitly but the rest of them will too depending how good you are. You don't have to live downtown either, South side Chicago is still a comfy working class community and Blue Island is full of local rowdy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfLpgTy1w7M">bands</a> you won't have any problems there. My reasons for working in finance are paid education. You get paid to go from technician to the Formula 1 race car engineer of software.

<h4 id="orga039caf">The work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga039caf">
<p>
Imagine all software bespoke from the server metal up where you are expected to quickly learn everything about L1/L2 caches and Intel features like Intel RDT (CAT,CMT) or Processor Trace. Not all the work is pure optimization these big funds now have large suites of custom client software and even roll their own internal email, code review software, even the compiler is almost entirely custom where I work. SQL queries are done using a DSL, the provenance of data is tracked with custom software, tl;dr everything is made in-house so you are always reinventing something from scratch. You typically start out working at the beginning of the critical path where hundreds of paid data feeds are coming in continuously or as a massive end of trading day dump in sizes you thought could only be fictional. One example is those 'no fee trading' middle-man brokerages like Robinhood they are selling their entire order book to a major HFT firm meaning someone had to write the entire execution pipeline that order book to be processed within microseconds.

<p>
Jove Intl, <a href="https://oxfordknight.co.uk/jobs/">Oxford Knight</a>, Reload Search, and ex-employees who have quit to become highly paid one-man recruiting shops most of whom are the one's I've been talking to after running into them at bars after work and at events. They hire internationally for Chicago, NYC, Austin, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Shanghai, Tokyo and now Singapore seems to be the location everyone is opening offices these days. If you include certain keywords on your LinkedIn like C++ these independents will find you though yes I also think LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> I've only ever used it to harvest recruiter offers.

<p>
They go over all resumes there's no automated ATS or applicant tracking system. USACO training stands out, so-called modern C++ meaning C++17/20/23 stands out but is not necessary as any firm will train you. You never sell yourself as a junior, companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed writing software even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer on Upwork actively looking for contract work which is exactly what we'll do here.

<h4 id="orgd0f8dfe">Campus recruiting</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd0f8dfe">
<p>
Getting more and more monopolized by big tech pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) that are against campus hiring guidelines but they do it anyway. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies further draining the hiring and internship pool. There is a lot of myths about working in finance too which prevents new grads applying but most of these are prop shops who invest only their own private funds where the profit is in identifying when a stock is priced lower than it should be then buying that stock to later make a profit once it inevitably rises. They call this 'fixing inefficiencies in the market' and it's much different than robber barons hedging bets against the success of companies like a small town mill to depress it's price then buying it cheap and holding a fire sale of all assets putting people out of work. You will know right away in the phone screen if you're being recruited to some kind of ghoulish fund like this but I've never seen them around.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga8bff22" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga8bff22">Phone screens</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga8bff22">
<p>
I don't know if they still do this but one Chicago company was notorious for firing off 3 problems to solve on Hackerrank seconds after you submitted an application. The first phone screen is usually a recruiter asking are you legal to work and if not what credentials do you have because in some countries like the US you will need a reason for them to issue you a work visa for a job that can't be given to a local so a degree or equivalent work experience. If they want you they'll finesse these requirements if not try Asia. They will of course dodge salary questions with the tried and true 'well I hire for x amount of countries so don't have that exact information right now' but in my experience they offer a range at least.   
</p>

<p>
If you have been vouched for, which is very common in the finance world, then you skip the second phone interview and come in for a casual meeting usually about whatever you previously built and they may ask you about details of the language you claim to be an expert in but mostly it will be just a friendly conversation. Any jargon you use they will ask you to define on the spot to catch you bluffing. If for whatever reasons you're asked to write code it will be to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> which is the new fizzbuzz filter everyone has adopted and tests how careless of a developer you are meaning you don't ask any questions about requirements and start writing code immediately. We were told if we were to personally vouch and refer candidates for an interview then our friends we vouched for could expect this friendly style of interview where basically they are trying to lure them from competitors. There's of a course a major catch. If we refer someone and they fail miserably meaning we are careless with referals just handing them out to anyone then we have to cover the cost of the interview which is thousands of dollars. That's what I meant earlier by saying you won't find legit referals anywhere handed out to strangers.   
</p>

<p>
If not vouched for expect the second zoom/phone call to be a typical algorithm style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg">interview</a>. Code correctness and caution is heavily favored over adding complexity to squeeze out some meaningless optimization of constant factors. As a personal anecdote these interview tasks are often designed as a trap to once again see how careless of a developer you are the problems I've seen have an obvious area of optimization to take that will open a potential bug or performance sink elsewhere if you aren't taking your time thinking through the whole original problem space. Prime example they will try and get you with is <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/">cache invalidation</a>. Hiring someone is an investment it will typically take 3 months for them to be productive and if you're being paid $200k/yr that's $50k they have spent hoping you will turn out to be a good hire so now you know why there is all these hoops to jump through.

<h4 id="org58f3414">Find a mentor</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org58f3414">
<p>
Once you are in and develop a routine walk over to the department where all the money is being made and find a mentor to teach you by asking them to give you the work they don't like doing because you want to learn it all from scratch. All you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually want you to work with them once you have proven to be indispensible. If they get promoted you get promoted, if they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you are serious about wanting to learn they will tell management to make it happen. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and my life would not be the same if I hadn't watched that throwaway clip at 3am because I always assumed there was no way I could ever do this kind of work.

If you're not interested in finance there are a few companies that mentor developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and build them to senior developers. One is in New Hampshire called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACO guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
USACO training is excellent and it's completely free. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A workbook on <a href="https://www.plai.org/">languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Explains that almost all industry popular languages are virtually identical and demystifies all the OOP jargon. We use a web-based <a href="https://github.com/LuKuangChen/stacker-2023">stacker</a> to see exactly how programs execute. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conceptual design <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
MIT course and book on how to design software people want to use.    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Probability/book.html">Queueing theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you write enough software eventually you discover that almost everything is some kind of queue pattern. This is another workbook that's Q&amp;A style not a giant theory text. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/">Advanced DBMS (OLAP)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we learn kernel bypass methods for low latency networking, multicore programming, hashing/join algorithms, search space complexity reduction, and modern distributed application architecture like microservices. We can also look at their AI tuning <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/">seminar</a> for relational dbms optimization knob tuning. Most of the assignments are finishing features in C++ for a teaching database with a Rust written optimizer but there's nothing stopping you from using whatever language you prefer. 
</p>

<p>
We will learn everything we can about C++ <a href="https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja?tab=readme-ov-file">profiling</a> and <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">performance engineering</a> taking some material on cache architecture from ETH Zurich and some compiler lectures about garbage collected runtimes for other languages.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and the professor of that course wrote a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. The first thing we will use this course for is to make a static site for ourselves which will be our business card we hand out as freelancers. See the recitation slides for <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/recitation-notes/R1_slides.pdf">VitePress</a> which we'll go through completely after learning git.  
</p>

<p>
Personal site examples
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This has <a href="https://www.strml.net/">potential</a> but intro before 'live coding' too long</li>
<li><a href="https://jasonpien.com/">Student</a> example though again intro should be cut</li>
<li><a href="https://512kb.club/">512kb club</a> lot's of good personal sites</li>
<li><a href="https://kru.run/win/98">Win98</a> example</li>
</ul>

<p>
Go through all the slides <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/schedule">here</a> though we don't have access to <i>Reactive Freameworks II</i> but we can read the diffs which we'll do after we learn git. These <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i> talk about coming up with ideas. Page 8 click on his riffle.systems idea where a 'reactive database' is used to declaratively write entire websites even generating the DOM elements thus totally replacing how modern webdev is done. Really all a web framework does is handle changing state and we've already learned how to best control state it's called a database management system. You can build a prototype of this yourself if interested after we take the advanced database content later in this workshop.
</p>

<p>
Concepts are introduced, see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOhtH3lugk&amp;list=PLY_nsiUEgM3nbxcO3_ONmKL-ZRhLKpfGV">YouTube video</a> from an AI talk at MIT where the professor of this course further explains what a concept is and how you would use them to get an LLM to develop an entire web app. Note that in their experiment they had to use 'a few hundred' prompts which then becomes your version history and I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to refactor a few hundred prompts but they made it easier with concepts. tl;dr AI will not be replacing webdev anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
To watch more about concepts click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. Watch the two lectures on concepts: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. Look at the recent <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">slides</a>. You have surely encountered badly designed software and this is a way to model your ideas as state machines then synch them together to compose an application that people can actually understand how to use. 
</p>

<p>
Now we want to go through all the project steps <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assignments">here</a> and build something but first let's get version control out of the way.

<p>
There's a <a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop/">GUI</a> for git you don't have to use the command line interface.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>. Lecture starts ~7m in. So far the data structure and model is trivial to understand if you did any intro course here such as <a href="./accelerated.html">CS19</a> learnings about DAGs. 
</p>

<p>
Proceed to <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> and navigate to research or <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> page on MIT's software design group. You will find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XZYMjg93o">this</a> talk about the problems with git design. The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeb2862e">
<p>
I'm going to do all the USACO contest problems using inquiry-based learning because that's exactly what you do in real life. If you took <a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a> you have already seen almost every topic in the USACO guide and if you didn't it doesn't matter that's why there exists a guide which we can look at while we solve a problem, so you learn the algorithm as you are using it.

<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember.

<div id="outline-container-org1db56f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1db56f3">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1db56f3">
<p>
The USACO guide has a good introduction to big-O and a resource we can use where running time is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

<h3 id="orge6bf501">Problem complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge6bf501">
<p>
Before we start trying to solve problems watch <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/lectures/L01.html">this</a> Erik Demaine lecture and skip to 09:00. We want to know what polynomial time is, what NP means, what satisfiability means and this is a good enough ~30m crash course in complexity as these concepts come up all the time in algorithm literature. He tells us most decision problems can't be solved by an algorithm which ruins the AI superintelligence dystopia. When he translates Super Mario Bros to a 3SAT decision problem we can see that almost every algorithm you can think of can be transformed to a decision problem. You don't have to keep watching this but there's an interesting intro to constraint logic/graphs. Now you can explain to someone P=NP means all the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms that always 'lucky guess' correctly or have a magic oracle can be solved by an algorithm in deterministic polynomial time which seems impossible. 
</p>

<p>
The rest of this course I won't do here but the book he wrote that goes with the lectures looks excellent covering topics in economics too.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f1ca99">
<p>
If you look at the archived <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results">contests</a> we are given all the test inputs/outputs as a .zip and a fully worked out solution with a proof of the bounds. This means <i>you can use any language you want</i> however I am going to do it all in C++ with Knuth's literate programming tool cweb because it mimics exactly how you would build something in a collaborative setting and after using it for a few problems it's kind of awesome and I finally get why Knuth shills this style of programming so much.
