I assume you are teaching yourself at the same time some kind of intro course you found on YouTube or a book somebody recommended such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Functional CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/sicp.html">SICP</a></li>
<li>anything</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is under construction as I have to work on it a few hours a day (from a phone, so spelling mistakes will frequently happen) until it's finished. Some days I have time and others I don't, you should take this for fun and not worry if nothing makes sense right away it never does but in time it will if you are persistant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pitch</b>
</p>

<p>
I am often in contact with <a href="https://joveinternational.com/markets-coverage/">recruiters</a> in finance and ask them what exactly do you want for basic entry-level candidates and would you look at resumes without a degree. People in this work are writing trading optimizers to lower fees on trades, extreme low-latency network software, and making data pipelines and models faster for quant researchers that process unthinkably huge amounts of proprietary data feeds. The answer is always a solid grasp of algorithms, memory and concurrency models, CPU-architecture (entire execution pipeline), systems calls, databases, and knowledge how to work around languages with managed runtimes because not everything is C++. If you show above average competency in at least some of the above then you can be taught the rest and are considered a good hire as these candidates can't easily be found anymore. 
</p>

<p>
Everything here was vetted by them over a few conversations as being desirable for a basic foundation for someone who doesn't have a degree. These recruiters are everywhere like Jove Intl, <a href="https://oxfordknight.co.uk/jobs/">Oxford Knight</a>, Reload Search, and ex-employees who have quit to become highly paid one-man recruiting shops most of whom are the one's I've been running into at events and talking to. They liked USACO training because these fintech outfits give you extra points for competitiveness of any kind (sports, CTFs, anything), PLAI.org programming language memory models, queueing theory, and Andy Pavlo's CMU course which teaches how modern high performance applications are designed. 
</p>

<p>
Even if you don't care at all about being employed and are writing your own side projects you'll want to know this to avoid paying massive amounts of resource costs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Selection</b>
</p>

<p>
They told me they go over all resumes, there's no automated system. USACO training stands out, C++17/20/23 stands out, everything else they'll phone you and ask. You never sell yourself as a junior. Companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed writing software even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer on Upwork and claiming 1 year experience since you probably have that anyway doing course assignments or side projects while learning. Candidates are always ranked, so you have to be better than everyone else who would automatically rank higher (degrees, work experience) which is possible through sheer determination because the hiring pool for entry level candidates who can both pass the interviews and are willing to stay on and become senior is very limited right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Retention</b>
</p>

<p>
Campus recruiting is getting more monopolized by big tech or shady outfits that manipulate school guidelines by pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) so it is a struggle to find any of the good grads to do this kind of work. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies further draining the hiring and internship pool. As a personal anecdote I've witnessed grads that were invested in heavily with signing bonuses, internships and training, totally ghost after working less than one year to become 'influencers' or start up some crypto scheme. Most don't want to race to entry and exit by tediously code profiling and tracing processes to shave a microsecond optimization but if you want to be the race car designer of software then you should try and get in as now is the best time.      
</p>

<p>
<b>Interviews</b>   
</p>

<p>
The interviews for these roles if you have been vouched for are often a single zoom call with a request to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> for the sole purpose of seeing if you even bother asking questions to clarify the requirements or work through edge cases. This is to guage how careless you are as a developer because mistakes cost money and is also essentially the new fizz buzz filter everyone has adopted. After expect to be asked about your chosen language's memory model in detail and any jargon you use they will ask you to define it on the spot to catch you bluffing. This is harder than it sounds because it's like an oral general exam in grad school where a committee tests your knowledge on the spot but nobody with the kind of experience who would be given this interview style should fail this.
</p>

<p>
However if you are a risk to them like a new grad then expect a longer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg">interview</a> with a collaborative design usually of a deceptively simple interface like a controller for movement in a game. The task is then to optimize this design and justify each stage of optimization such as knowing about elementary queueing theory techniques to reduce wait times and amortized analysis of whatever queue data structure you come up with. At any stage if you have a potential for a bug like not thinking through all the edge cases during optimization you're rejected. Code correctness and caution is heavily favored over adding complexity to squeeze out some meaningless constant factors. Another personal anecdote I've witnessed, these interview tasks are always designed as a trap to once again see how careless of a developer you are the problems I've seen have an obvious area of optimization to take that will open up some correctness problem if you aren't taking your time thinking through the whole problem space. If you wrote it using objects they'll ask about object cache misses during a loop where a new allocation on the heap is made and ruins performance. In the end they really just want to see what you are like to work with and that you have high standards in your work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mentors</b>
</p>

<p>
Once you are in and survive long enough to develop a routine walk over to the department where all the money is being made and find a mentor to teach you by asking them to give you the work they don't like doing because you want to learn it all from scratch. All you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually want you to work with them once you have proven to be indispensible and transfer you internally with double the salary. If they get promoted you get promoted, if they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you are serious about wanting to learn they will tell management to make it happen. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and my life would not be the same if I hadn't watched that throwaway clip at 3am because I always assumed there was no way I could ever do this kind of work.
</p>

<p>
If you're not interested in finance there are a few companies that mentor junior developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and build them to senior developers. One is in NH called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer. 
</p>

<p>
If you contribute to open source projects they will teach you as well and you will pick up work for example while writing this workshop I tried out contributing to <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/">Blender</a> then made a LinkedIn profile claiming to be a self-taught student and C++ developer with a single small feature as my portfolio. Numerous local gaming companies tried to recruit me shortly after saying they would train and offering all kinds of signing bonuses. LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> I've only ever used it to harvest recruiter offers.
</p>

<p>
Of course not all fintech outfits are worth working at, do your own research. Prefer the places where you aren't answering to a bunch of traders because then you have dozens of unofficial bosses who consider you in the way of their bonus if any systems go down.

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
USACO training is excellent and it's completely free. We can use the lecture notes <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451-s24/notes.pdf">here</a> to learn how to justify asymptotic bounds of algorithms we design.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A workbook on <a href="https://www.plai.org/">languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Explains that almost all industry popular languages are virtually identical and demystifies all the OOP jargon. It's a workbook we use a web-based <a href="https://github.com/LuKuangChen/stacker-2023">stacker</a> to see exactly how programs execute. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conceptual design <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
MIT course and book on how to design software people want to use.    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Probability/book.html">Queueing theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you write enough software eventually you discover that almost everything is some kind of queue pattern. This is another workbook that's Q&amp;A style not a giant theory text. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/">Advanced DBMS (OLAP)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we learn kernel bypass methods for low latency networking, code profiling and optimization, hashing/join algorithms, search space complexity reduction, and modern distributed application architecture like microservices. We also learn CPU-arch, cache memory hierarchy, and operating systems. We can also look at their AI tuning <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/">seminar</a> for relational dbms optimization knob tuning. Most of the assignments are finishing features on github for a teaching database with a rust written optimizer but there's nothing stopping you from using whatever language you prefer.

I'm going to do all the USACO contest problems using inquiry-based learning because that's exactly what you do in real life. If you took <a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a> you have already seen almost every topic in the USACO guide and if you didn't it doesn't matter that's why there exists a guide which we can look at while we solve a problem, so you learn the algorithm as you are using it.

<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)

std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember.

<h3 id="org01f1a32">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org01f1a32">
<p>
The USACO guide has a good introduction to big-O and a resource we can use where running time is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

Before we start trying to solve problems watch <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/lectures/L01.html">this</a> Erik Demaine lecture and skip to 09:00. We want to know what polynomial time is, what NP means, what satisfiability means and this is a good enough ~30m crash course in complexity as these concepts come up all the time in algorithm literature. He tells us most decision problems can't be solved by an algorithm which ruins the AI superintelligence dystopia. When he translates Super Mario Bros to a 3SAT decision problem we can see that almost every algorithm you can think of can be transformed to a decision problem. You don't have to keep watching this but there's an interesting intro to constraint logic/graphs. Now you can explain to someone P=NP means all the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms that always 'lucky guess' correctly or have a magic oracle can be solved by an algorithm in deterministic polynomial time which seems impossible. 
</p>

<p>
The rest of this course I won't do here but the book he wrote that goes with the lectures looks excellent covering topics in economics too.

If you look at the archived <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results">contests</a> we are given all the test inputs/outputs as a .zip and a fully worked out solution with a proof of the bounds. This means <i>you can use any language you want</i> however I am going to do it all in C++ with Knuth's literate programming tool cweb because it mimics exactly how you would build something in a collaborative setting and after using it for a few problems it's kind of awesome and I finally get why Knuth shills this style of programming so much.  
</p>

<p>
Each problem we solve we can use a bit of the reading from <a href="https://jshun.csail.mit.edu/6506-s23/">6.506 Algorithm Engineering</a> on how exactly we would benchmark our programs and analyze their running time, esp helpful if you aren't using the online USACO judge to run your code and want to know how fast it truly is.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. It used to be called 6.170 before MIT renumbered every course recently. Universities always do ridiculous things every 3-5 years it's like some new dean comes in and demands oh we have to reinvent everything and buy all new (awful) edtech. 
</p>

<p>
First look at these <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> from 2023 titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i> it briefly explains how you go from brainstorming features of something you want to build into concepts. 
</p>

<p>
Click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. They are all worth watching but we are interested in the two lectures on conceptual design. Watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. Look at the recent <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">slides</a>. You have surely encountered badly designed software and this is a way to model your ideas as state machines then synch them together to compose an application that people can actually understand how to use. If you don't understand what you just looked at don't worry we'll be implementing it in full you will get it.

Now we are going to take all the above introductions to conceptual design and rewrite the git interface to make it intuitive to use. We have to learn git anyway so may as well write a CLI (command line interface) or you could make it ridiculous and call it 'visual git' or something with DAG graphics.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>. Lecture starts ~7m in. So far the data structure and model is trivial to understand if you did any intro course here such as <a href="./accelerated.html">CS19</a> learnings about DAGs. 
</p>

<p>
Proceed to <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> and navigate to research or <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> page on MIT's software design group. You will find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XZYMjg93o">this</a> talk about the problems with git design. The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills).
