<h4 id="org57ca3ad">Finance jobs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org57ca3ad">
<p>
I often meet up with software <a href="https://joveinternational.com/markets-coverage/">recruiters</a> in finance who tell me a tale of woe how much harder it's become to find candidates so I asked them what exactly do you want these days for a basic new grad style candidate and would they look at resumes without a degree. The following curriculum is a result of these conversations which are ongoing as I've been toying with the idea <i>can I teach someone to do what we do here from scratch</i> so they don't have to spend $90k or whatever the total cost is now for an undergrad at even a public university. I have no intention of creating a new filter or mandatory hoop people must jump through this is simply a collection of free materials to optionally take if you don't have a degree.    
</p>

<p>
The recruiters told me if they could find a non-degree candidate that knows the entire CPU-arch execution pipeline and can answer any question about how an eviction from the cache might happen (like mutating state/hash collision) then they get a point. If they know a language extremely well like they've been using it everyday and can explain how it abstracts the memory including it's managed runtime if it has one then that's another point. If they have provable problem solving skills typically taught by competitive programming where given a seemingly impossible problem the candidate can at least work to a non-optimized solution without immediately giving up then that's another point. Finally if they can do all of the above with a very high standard of code quality then that is the perfect introductory candidate who can be taught anything else needed and they should be contacting recruiters asap. All of the above is not impossible to teach yourself so I will do just that here to prove it can be done. 
</p>

<p>
There's many reasons why you'd want to work for <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisaycock/8b7a37b1f97549517cb7789be5b06266">trading firms</a> and most of them like Valkyrie will hire <a href="https://www.valkyrietrading.com/careers/junior-software-engineer/">juniors</a>. Chicago still has some good neighborhoods like Blue Island on the south side where the band <a href="https://youtu.be/WfLpgTy1w7M?si=GDUJqkkvK0TvXWWW">Fear City</a> reigns and downtown BI is awesome old school working class, no problems at all. You may think writing software places you in a different class but we're just wagies like everyone else and some of these construction specialty contractor guys on the south side are making the same or more amount of money than we do these days.

<h4 id="org63ef195">The work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org63ef195">
<p>
Imagine all software is bespoke from the server metal up where you are expected to quickly learn everything about L1/L2 caches and Intel features like Intel RDT (CAT,CMT) or Processor Trace. These big funds now have large suites of custom client software and even roll their own internal email, code review software, even the compiler is almost entirely custom where I work. SQL queries are done using a DSL, the provenance of data is tracked with custom software, tl;dr everything is made in-house so you are always reinventing something from scratch.

<p>
Jove Intl, <a href="https://oxfordknight.co.uk/jobs/">Oxford Knight</a>, Reload Search, and ex-employees who have quit to become highly paid one-man recruiting shops most of whom are the one's I've been talking to after running into them at bars after work and at events. They hire internationally for Chicago, NYC, Austin, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Shanghai, Tokyo and now Singapore seems to be the location everyone is opening offices these days. LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> but works fine for harvesting recruiter offers.

<h4 id="org1a3fb15">Selection</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1a3fb15">
<p>
They go over all resumes there's no automated ATS or applicant tracking system. USACO training stands out, so-called modern C++ meaning C++17/20/23 stands out but is not necessary as any firm will train you. You never sell yourself as a junior, companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed writing software even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer on Upwork actively looking for contract work which is exactly what we'll do here.

<div id="outline-container-org324995e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org324995e">Campus recruiting</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org324995e">
<p>
Getting more and more monopolized by big tech pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) that are against campus hiring guidelines but they do it anyway. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies further draining the hiring and internship pool. There is a lot of myths about working in finance too which prevents new grads applying but most of these are prop shops who invest only their own private funds where the profit is in identifying when a stock is priced lower than it should be then buying that stock to later make a profit once it inevitably rises. They call this 'fixing inefficiencies in the market' and it's much different than robber barons hedging bets against the success of companies like a small town mill to depress it's price then buying it cheap and holding a fire sale of all assets putting people out of work. You will know right away in the phone screen if you're being recruited to some kind of ghoulish fund like this but I've never seen them around.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org256e8a9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org256e8a9">Phone screens</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org256e8a9">
<p>
I don't know if they still do this but one Chicago company was notorious for firing off 3 problems to solve on Hackerrank seconds after you submitted an application. The first phone screen is usually a recruiter asking are you legal to work and if not what credentials do you have because in some countries like the US you will need a reason for them to issue you a work visa for a job that can't be given to a local so a degree or equivalent work experience. If they want you they'll finesse these requirements if not try Asia. They will of course dodge salary questions with the tried and true 'well I hire for x amount of countries so don't have that exact information right now' but in my experience they offer a range at least.   
</p>

<p>
If you have been vouched for, which is very common in the finance world once you know people, then you skip the second phone interview and come in for a casual meeting usually about whatever you previously built and they may ask you about details of the language you claim to be an expert in but mostly it will be just a friendly conversation. Any jargon you use they will ask you to define on the spot to catch you bluffing. If for whatever reasons you're asked to write code it will be to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> which is the new fizzbuzz filter everyone has adopted and tests how careless of a developer you are meaning you don't ask any questions about requirements and start writing code immediately.
</p>

<p>
If not personally vouched by someone expect the second zoom/phone call to be a typical algorithm style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg">interview</a>. Code correctness and caution is heavily favored over adding complexity to squeeze out some meaningless optimization of constant factors. As a personal anecdote these interview tasks are often designed as a trap to once again see how careless of a developer you are the problems I've seen have an obvious area of optimization to take that will open a potential bug or performance sink elsewhere if you aren't taking your time thinking through the whole original problem space. Prime example they will try and get you with is <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/">cache invalidation</a>. Hiring someone is an investment it will typically take 3 months for them to be productive and if you're being paid $200k/yr that's $50k they have spent hoping you will turn out to be a good hire so now you know why there is all these hoops to jump through.

<div id="outline-container-orgd835245" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd835245">Find a mentor</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd835245">
<p>
Once you are in and develop a routine walk over to the department where all the money is being made and find a mentor to teach you by asking them to give you the work they don't like doing because you want to learn it all from scratch. All you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually want you to work with them once you have proven to be indispensible. If they get promoted you get promoted, if they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you are serious about wanting to learn they will tell management to make it happen. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and my life would not be the same if I hadn't watched that throwaway clip at 3am because I always assumed there was no way I could ever do this kind of work.

If you're not interested in finance there are a few companies that mentor developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and build them to senior developers. One is in New Hampshire called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and the professor of that course wrote a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. This is how you design software on a piece of paper from beginning to end so when it comes time to actually code the app it essentially writes itself. You could try and use whatever co-pilot type service or Chat-GPT to generate all the features though that would probably take longer screwing around with prompts than just coding it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOhtH3lugk&amp;list=PLY_nsiUEgM3nbxcO3_ONmKL-ZRhLKpfGV">YouTube video</a> from an AI talk at MIT where the professor of this course further explains what a concept is using the same HN example and how you would use them to get an LLM to develop an entire web app. In their experiment they had to use 'a few hundred' prompts which then becomes your version history and I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to refactor a few hundred prompts but they made it easier with concepts which are tiny state machines running mostly without dependencies on other features.

Audit through the slides first then come back to see them in detail when building something:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">Diverge/Converge</a> Brainstorm ideas then turn those ideas into concepts and work out the interface they will each need. In the tutorial for <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/divergent-tactics/">divergent design</a> on the prof's personal site he used Chat-GPT to suggest additional features.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Page 8 check out his riffle.systems idea where a 'reactive database' is used to declaratively write entire websites even generating the DOM elements thus totally replacing how modern webdev is done. I got stuck here and never left after reading these papers and have been toying with a prototype. We've already learned how to best control state it's called a database management system we can embed in webasm or write a phone/desktop app that has a customized one. If you want to build a prototype as well take the rest of this workshop! We cover both relational databases from scratch and a programming language book to write your own declarative language as recommended by the authors of the paper. 
</p>

<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/recitations/recitation-2">Wireframing</a> recitation. If you go on Upwork or other freelancing sites you will see many jobs looking for someone to take a figma design and turn it into a working app.</li>
<li>More <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">Concepts</a> and at the end of these slides you have a complete draft of an application that is now trivial to code into an MVP or minimum viable product (MVP). To watch more about concepts see <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. Watch the two lectures on concepts: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. The author goes through each topic like what an operational principle is on his tutorial page <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/">here</a> and completely explains how these are <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/concept-basics/concept-as-machine/">state machines</a> and how to define the <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/concept-basics/state/">state</a> of concepts.</li>
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L5.pdf">Design moves</a> how to unify or loosen concepts with many examples here like Zoom's screwy interface or Gmail labels.</li>
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L6.pdf">API design</a> what a RESTful API is. GraphQL is a query language and if you take the dbms content here it will be trivial to understand. Notice there is a recurring theme here of databases and declarative query languages in webdev because as mentioned earlier that's the best way to store and retrieve state.</li>
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L7.pdf">Data design</a> there are recorded lectures <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a> and we'll be learning relational databases and SQL in detail after this in a seperate course but skimming this content is interesting. The 'multiplicities' in the model diagrams you probably recognize from regex. NoSQL is introduced here which you never want to use if not writing a temporary prototype as doing updates and inserts as JSON is a convoluted mess. Postgresql has basically taken over website data storage and we'll learn all about it.</li>
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L10.pdf">Make things learnable</a> anyone should be able to figure out your software without relying on documentation. Notable examples of software where you cannot do anything without extensive docs is Tailwind CSS, Git and Blender.</li>

</ul>

<p>
There are more slides and recorded lectures <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a> about UIX design if you're interested but we got what we came for. Brainstorm ideas, converge them into separate interfaces on a piece of paper like they are independent microservices. Write out a dependency diagram by going back to the slides when designing your own app and looking at what they did. Go by the criteria: A 'uses' B only if A is simpler because it uses B and B is simpler because it doesn't need A. There is no useful subset containing A but not B. That means a legit dependency. Wait until you get paid to do this somewhere, everyone breaks the above advice and you get stuck fixing their countless needless dependencies that make your life hell!

<h3 id="org67c172d">Version control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67c172d">
<p>
The prof of this course with a grad student created <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> see <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> research page on MIT's software design group. Read how they audited the conceptual design of Git and found things like staging were confusing. 
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to that file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development. 
</p>

<p>
For these reasons I don't think you should bother to use git at all unless someone is forcing you. Look up how easy and simple the Mercurial guide is for a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/guide#lone_developer">lone developer</a> why use anything else. If you must then try MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i> or read 'Git for Hackers' floating around. Git is literally some junk Torvalds invented because he couldn't handle CVS. Open source development outside of FOSS you generally fork the project to your account on Github, commit changes there then make a 'Pull Request' or PR to the original repo asking if they will merge your changes. The FOSS way is different using Savannah for example here is a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?10210">patch</a> it's all done in plain text using a traditional mailing list style of attaching files and people vote on it.

<h3 id="orgc1fcaca">Software freelancing strategies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc1fcaca">
<p>
Who needs software where you live? Restaurants, people cutting hair either out of their house or a storefront, people wanting to sell something to avoid Shopify fees, people wanting to rent their condo public spaces or guest suites, people wanting a dashboard of all sites they are selling on combined into one command page. Every service needs a booking or quote site such as painters, tailors or power washers or junk haulers. Is there a 'restaurant row' where you live meaning wall to wall bars and restaurants well they all they need staff what about a shift marketplace so freelance wait staff can move around and take extra shifts? There's always something people want and the current offers for the service industry are largely pure shit. 
</p>

<p>
My recommendation is to be the local Zapier style developer and stitch together software people actually use instead of inventing an inferior product yourself like everyone else is doing. People are already using business software they prefer like Quickbooks for accounting or Zoho/Salesforce for CRM, or iCal/Google calendar for bookings. You now sew that all together into a custom product for them.

<div id="outline-container-org14b7d77" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org14b7d77">Starting out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org14b7d77">
<p>
I tried a local experiment for now 3 weeks because I'm a bit of a gonzo journalist that <a href="http://www.infiltration.org/">infiltrates</a> everything I can while following the advice of the Y Combinator startup school which is to talk to every customer. I even bought a membership at the fancy social club here which is largely real estate developers, pricy restaurant owners, extremely rich people doing side projects and shady diamond dealers. The goal was to ask people about their business and what problems they were having to see if software could help. You just let others talk about themselves and interview them without coming across as sales-y. I ended up with dozens of leads and if I was a software mercenary I would have picked up a lot of work. Unfortunately I'm not a software merc but kind of thinking I should be now that I've seen how easy it is. Everyone wants to work with someone they've personally met not a stranger on a website and almost every conversation ended with 'do you know anyone who can do this' and them giving me their contacts. 
</p>

<p>
I also called people out of the blue from LinkedIn from various local companies and just told them hey I'm trying to find out about your work tell me everything about it and they talked to me too which was not what I expected. I even met 3 of them for lunch and was immediately given leads I'm honestly surprised how easy this is to do making me think I chose the wrong career I should quit and just be the local king of software who can make anything happen, hire a staff of wagies and spend all day meeting people.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd6976b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbd6976b">Research</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd6976b">
<p>
Here's what I found out by just walking into places and meeting people. Every one of them had a problem with existing software they wanted to modify and they had <i>never</i> met anyone locally who could independently write software who wasn't some SaaS sales guy pushing an existing product.  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6ac4772" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6ac4772">Salons</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6ac4772">
<p>
An <a href="http://www.nailproject.com/">example</a> using a Brooklyn nail salon. Their website basically points to Instagram and solely consists of a <a href="http://www.nailproject.com/">form</a> that means they will have to phone or text/email whoever books to correct any over bookings. This can all be automated easily and sync some iCal protocol. Every one of these businesses rents out chairs to independent freelancers so they needed a fast way to add/remove new names to the booking calendar as these freelancers move around all the time. Deposit for reservations they wanted too but nobody offers this.
</p>

<p>
Many of these are now mixed meaning some girl doing tattoos will be working out of 'Clarissa's Nails' and while I was standing outside these places entering notes in my phone I had a few customers asking me if I've heard of 'Samantha's Tattoos' or whatever because it wasn't clear on any of their websites they were a single business. There's another problem easily solved with custom software. 
</p>

<p>
My own barber mainly took appointments by phone call or text message than had to manually enter it into some shared iCal protocol scheme the shop maintained as a centralized accounting as all barbershops rent chairs to visiting freelance barbers too. This can be automated. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbda562d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbda562d">Restaurants/Bars</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbda562d">
<p>
Restaurants I found use at least 3-4 different software vendors. Every one prefers to handwrite tickets and have the wait staff manually enter it into an inventory and restaurant management system that uses a proven industry touch screen for high volume that's not some consumer grade junk like iPads. Problem here was there was only one touch screen so they had to take turns doing it as adding another would cost thousands in 'set up fees' to have a tech come do it. I didn't have much time so got the make/model of the screen, cables and inventory vendor which all had open APIs so you could if you wanted set up another screen for free. These inventory apps had a total monopoly over the entire city and would be impossible to compete with as everyone uses them by default since they offer one-click bill splitting, labour and scheduling, inventory, menu management and accounting which I found out has to be certified as there's a lot of tax fraud in restaurants so some regulator has to approve your software. We don't have to compete with that just interface with it.
</p>

<p>
The second software they used was reservations which we can compete with. They absolutely hated every option because of insanity level fees like 10-20% 'service charge' being added on which customers mistakenly thought was the tip but it was the scam fee for the online booking service. Prepaid reservations of any amount reduced no shows and only 1 online service they knew of offered it but charged way too much. All trivial to setup using Stripe or whatever merchant processor they want. You could change this to be like buying a ticket for a reservation and offering an online platform to buy/sell them but then you run into problems of potential restaurant booking scalpers but if the market demands it so be it. 
</p>

<p>
The third software they used was online orders/main website which usually just redirected to uber or similar gig service for online orders. The #1 request was to centralize all these 3rd party order sites into a single dashboard. Another request was some kind of dashboard for reputation management and a way to capture and control reviews meaning if you had a bad review you get directed to management to correct and if it was a good review you are redirected to google reviews or elsewhere. This is trivial to do too send an email 'yes/no' and if they click yes redirect to a public review site. I'm sure there's better techniques but I didn't look into it too much but surprisingly not a lot of services offer reputation management for small businesses just trying to survive some campaign from an idiot determined to shut them down. This seems like a good startup idea and if you interview restaurant owners you can find and get the lowdown on how it all works, monopolize reputation management. 
</p>

<p>
Not a single one I talked to had ever met a software guy in person and were surprised to see me asking a lot of questions like how can I take an online order directly and avoid paying massive fees, how can I automate ticket sales for live bands, how can we sell merch,  how can I adjust the lights in the restaurant at set times, how can I interface x accounting software with y mandatory gov inventory software and many other problems this was a gold mine of potential work I didn't expect. Nobody told me to screw off because I wasn't selling anything I was just buying their services and asking questions. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgba8b855" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgba8b855">Retail</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgba8b855">
<p>
Shopify has stupid fees and a convoluted php/wordpress like barrier to entry nobody can understand. Etsy and Square Space are meh but at least free to just use without payment. If you look at Huntsman suit tailors on Savile Row they have an interesting website where you can click <i>Made to Order</i> and customize almost everything. This was trivial to copy (make your own gfx to not rip them off and get sued) I simply used an AI to make outlines. I approached every tailor locally and every one said this is exactly what they wanted plus some kind of zoom/facetime way to book consultations. This was an instant sale so I handed it off to some guy I recruited on Craigslist as my plate is already full but once again surprised how easy this was and noone had ever talked to anyone who make bespoke software.
</p>

<p>
Small grocery stores all had software where you could extract or 'ETL' data into some kind of online site and sync them together to give them a good enough website for online orders. You know what doesn't exist is gig worker local produce pickers like someone paid to perfectly pick out produce and deliver it. Have you ever ordered from stores the wagies send you absolute shit 'here's your trash fruit bro'. 
</p>

<p>
Most retail I found the barrier to entry was figuring out how to add inventory easily that interfaces with their existing software and there's a site of course that has mastered this called <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">https://www.mcmaster.com/</a>. Notice how well done that site is it's exactly what a mechanical engineer would want when ordering product such as getting free CAD files to add to their project and then push a button and mass order everything. If you look up their careers page they are using just react + some junk to do this but interesting how they don't hire tech people they hire anybody and say they will train them from scratch to work on their website.

<h4 id="org8106251">Dashboards</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8106251">
<p>
As I mentioned everyone wanted these and it's what Planatir offers they come in and do full data analytics of the whole company and put it all together so you can see it. Without exception, all wanted some kind of visual representation of their biz in an easy analytical command center and what was going on with the competition and told me they would pay insane amounts of money for this. If I wasn't busy doing 100 other things I would probably be chasing this right now. I made a shitty mockup for one company and the guy wanted to buy it right away but I just gave it to him for free and handed it all off to the same guy I met on Craigslist (see above) but wow this is why Planatir is making bank. The Craigslist wagie I randomly found is now getting paid a lot of money working F/T for everyone I talked to you guys should try this yourself it's like shooting fish in a barrel. 
</p>

<p>
To recap
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nobody knows anyone who can write software let alone good software like we can</li>
<li>everyone wants a video game like HUD where your entire biz is laid out</li>
<li>everyone hates the existing SaaS offers but uses them because they have to (monopoly) but we can squeeze in there and just stitch stuff together and maybe even pick off the monopoly if we learn enough about this&#x2026; I spent just a few weeks and they were throwing money at me</li>

<div id="outline-container-org725537a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org725537a">Rates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org725537a">
<p>
You will want to bill daily not hourly. Keep increasing your rates too, if you have so many clients you can't accomodate them all then you're not charging enough of a daily rate. Sites like Upwork or whatever other freelancer job boards that are review based you have to bite the bullet and offer yourself for scraps at first just to get some kind of reputation then from there can charge whatever you want. Once I had rep on Upwork I changed my rate to something ridiculous and still get offers sent to me because I am selling the kind of optimization we will learn in the Andy Pavlo CMU course after this.

<div id="outline-container-org19b8a2e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org19b8a2e">Agencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org19b8a2e">
<p>
Search for agencies and you will <a href="https://www.charleagency.com/">find</a> many of them. Agencies are often never hiring because they find people to work there by approaching the best in the business and asking them to join the agency. This is how architect agencies work, ad agencies, etc. Make an example site template if it's Shopify or full site demo of your skills and ask them to send you work to do for free because you want to learn. They will if your demo is impressive. They will hire you F/T too if the work you return is good. Most of ecommerce is still just Shopify and WooCommerce somehow. There's probably agencies in your city they will be more receptive to meeting and working with you than some remote agency.

<div id="outline-container-orgdec85e7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdec85e7">Kick the door down in an existing market and take everything</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdec85e7">
<p>
Another way I started out and still operate is I will go on software marketplaces like Shopify or wherever business app marketplace where software is sold and I read all the reviews to find out what paying customers hate about the product. I actually make a list of these complaints and then clone that software and incorporate all the features and fixes then contact those customers directly. I can do this because I'm using OCaml (in the past Lisp) and you write very little code like adding dozens of new checkout options is just a functor over a checkout module but my problem is I'm a one man show so I can't do 24/7 support like some of them offer but many times just adding the features and talking to customers directly led to success. I was banned for doing this because I was too young and did it way too aggressively but definitely find software people pay for you think you can clone yourself and see what the problems are. Adding forms to Shopify pages is a major issue nobody has fixed you could kick down that door and take everyone's money look at the reviews they're all awful.

<h3 id="org0ae452a">Making a startup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0ae452a">
<p>
A real startup requires venture capital. Here's Peter Thiel giving a very good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k">crash course</a> in making a startup to Stanford students. Everything he says is true whatever market you are targeting you should be expecting to take that entire market or nobody will invest. Start small and monopolize something small. Here's an old article of Sam Altman of Open AI (now a monopoly too) talking about how Y Combinator's success is due to it being &#x2026; a <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/sam-altman-yc-monopoly.html">monopoly</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I researched the Y Combinator startup school so you don't have to and they tell you as a founder everyday you are only talking to customers. If you have 5 customers you talk to them everyday and ask them about their needs and make the wagies implement those features. If you have 50 customers you still talk to them everyday like the Stripe founder did. If you have no customers you phone everyone you can in the business niche you are targeting and find out what they want eventually they will start paying you. That is literally it there's no other magic or anything it's just talk to absolutely everybody who is paying for your service or may pay for it and build growth by listening to them and making a product that others will want because you listened.

Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember.

<h3 id="orgd6c22f2">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd6c22f2">
<p>
The USACO guide has a good introduction to big-O and a resource we can use where running time is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

<p>
Before we start trying to solve problems watch <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.5440/fall23/lectures/L01.html">this</a> Erik Demaine lecture and skip to 09:00. We want to know what polynomial time is, what NP means, what satisfiability means and this is a good enough ~30m crash course in complexity as these concepts come up all the time in algorithm literature. He tells us most decision problems can't be solved by an algorithm which ruins the AI superintelligence dystopia. When he translates Super Mario Bros to a 3SAT decision problem we can see that almost every algorithm you can think of can be transformed to a decision problem. You don't have to keep watching this but there's an interesting intro to constraint logic/graphs. Now you can explain to someone P=NP means all the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms that always 'lucky guess' correctly or have a magic oracle can be solved by an algorithm in deterministic polynomial time which seems impossible. 
</p>

<p>
The rest of this course I won't do here but the book he wrote that goes with the lectures looks excellent covering topics in economics too.

If you look at the archived <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results">contests</a> we are given all the test inputs/outputs as a .zip and a fully worked out solution with a proof of the bounds. This means <i>you can use any language you want</i> however I am going to do it all in C++ with Knuth's literate programming tool cweb because it mimics exactly how you would build something in a collaborative setting and after using it for a few problems it's kind of awesome and I finally get why Knuth shills this style of programming so much.
