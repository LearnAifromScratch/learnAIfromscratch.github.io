I assume you are teaching yourself at the same time some kind of intro course you found on YouTube or a book somebody recommended such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Functional CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/sicp.html">SICP</a></li>
<li>anything</li>
</ul>

<p>
This exists to solve two problems. 
</p>

<p>
The first is finding a job or freelancing which <i>seems</i> like it's next to impossible these days but they are desperate for developers who know the skills we'll be doing here.
</p>

<p>
The second problem is recruiters always ask me where to find candidates for fintech roles like 'quant developer'. I pressed them on what exactly they look for in 2024 then found free resources that taught as close to the requirements as possible. Everything here was vetted by them as being desirable as a basic foundation (USACO, plai.org, queueing theory, some experience with low-latency network kernel bypass) then the character of the candidate is the determining factor not their claimed experience or credentials. What they want is someone with the ability to figure out things themselves but who knows what they don't know meaning they won't bluff their way through meetings or sabotage the code with unexpected side effects. This person can write software for high throughput applications and can describe in detail the language they are using meaning how the memory abstraction works and if it's a managed runtime how to tune or avoid triggering unnecessary garbage collection. If you possess the above then they claim you can be taught everything else. 
</p>

<p>
Campus recruiting used to cover this but today is monopolized by big tech corps and government crony-run contractors that manipulate school guidelines by pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers and paying the school to lock out all competition so it's a struggle to find anyone qualified to do this kind of work as many companies can't even break into the campus internship or graduate hiring pool.

There will be much more than this such as software design but here is a brief choose your own adventure.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACO guide</a> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>w/ optional <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-851-advanced-data-structures-spring-2012/pages/assignments/">data structures</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15850/">algorithm design</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6506-s23/">algorithm engineering</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The USACO guide is excellent at preparing you for any kind of algorithmic test filtering companies may do and it's completely free. This is what the national US team for the info olympiad uses to recruit for further coaching and if you <a href="https://www.ioi2024.eg/">notice</a> many of the sponsors are all finance corps or telecoms because this is how they find the best raw talent.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A workbook on <a href="https://www.plai.org/">languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Explains that almost all industry popular languages are virtually identical and demystifies all the OOP jargon. It's a workbook we use a web-based <a href="https://github.com/LuKuangChen/stacker-2023">stacker</a> to see exactly how programs execute.    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Probability/book.html">Queueing theory</a> and probability models</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you write enough software eventually you discover that almost everything is some kind of queue pattern. This is another workbook that's Q&amp;A style not a giant theory text.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/">Advanced DBMS (OLAP)</a> system design for analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we learn kernel bypass methods for low latency networking, code profiling and optimization, hashing/join algorithms, search space complexity reduction, and modern distributed application architecture like microservices. We can also look at their AI tuning <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/">seminar</a> for relational dbms optimization knob tuning.

<p>
Find a mentor. There is someone somewhere doing what you want to do and making a lot of money doing it and your task is to complete enough material here to reach a level where you can get in with them somehow and absorb everything. Once you are in all you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life. If they get promoted you get promoted. If they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. If they get hired at a top trading firm everyone says you have no chance of getting into guess who they will tell the hiring managers they should also hire. 
</p>

<p>
You approach this person and sell yourself telling them you are available if they have some work because you want to learn it all from the ground up. There is always something to do and your goal is to be this magic portal where tedious work they despise doing can be dumped and it returns as per specifications they gave you. If you can do this then there's time for them to show you things. You eventually make your way up to highly sophisticated work until you end up being essential to them where they couldn't imagine going back to working without you because it's a mutually beneficial relationship. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and it worked. In fintech, this can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you sell yourself to them that you are serious about being mentored they will tell management to make it happen.

<div id="outline-container-orgeac952e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeac952e">Make yourself appear employed</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeac952e">
<p>
Some advice from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40478197">here</a>: "If you can, try to appear employed. For better or worse, people will see you as more desirable if you are employed. This might mean setting up an LLC called Foo Software, giving yourself the role of Software Engineer, and then bidding on projects on Upwork. You don't have to lie about what you are doing if anyone asks (and most won't ask for details), but this gives you something to put on your resume and some experience."

<h4 id="org2b1f884">Contribute to FSF</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2b1f884">
<p>
You will best be able to pull this off if you actually can commit code somewhere and receive feedback until you become a competent developer people can trust. I recommend only ever contributing to 'free software' as in GNU <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> projects like Blender or the gcc compiler are filled with experts that can mentor you. Look through the optimization tags on Blender's issues list there is a lot of opportunity to practice what we learn here and have it reviewed.

In competitive programming you submit source code as a solution to a problem and the online judge compiles and runs your code against tests. There is a huge list of online judges available like Kattis, SPOJ, Timus, Aizu, and more <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/olympiads?lang=cpp">worldwide</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Choose one of these <a href="https://open.kattis.com/languages">languages</a>. List all the problems by <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems?order=difficulty_data">easiest</a> and start with the very first one 'Velkomin!'. You get unlimited submissions to the Kattis judge. There's the USACO <a href="https://ide.usaco.guide/">online IDE</a> too if you want or many other <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/running-code-online?lang=cpp">online IDEs</a> or use the Kattis source text box to enter code none of these beginner problems require an IDE.
</p>

<p>
<b>Input/Output</b>
</p>

<p>
Read the USACO <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/input-output">guide</a> first chapter to teach yourself how input/output works in C/C++/Java/Python. 
</p>

<p>
The problem <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/qaly">qaly</a> is an example of how to take multiple lines of input. Usually the first input will be how much more input to expect which you can then loop on:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int tt;  
    double sum = 0;  
    cin &gt;&gt; tt;   // pipe first stdin to tt
    while (tt--) {  // false when input empty 
        double a, b;  // each loop declare these 2 new assignables
        cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b; // take 2 more inputs
        sum = sum + (a * b);  // accumulator
        }
    cout &lt;&lt; sum;  // pipe sum to stdout
}
</pre>

<p>
Do enough of these until you get the hang of I/O in your language. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later for the ICPC. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like <a href="https://mingw.osdn.io/">MinGW</a> and a <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">file manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem, then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, or you can figure out yourself as you go, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he looks up the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember if debugging and believing your solution still isn't optimized enough, resubmit anyway as you get unlimited submissions.

<b>USACO bronze</b> 
</p>

<p>
We are now <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze/">bronze level</a>. There's a set of videos for bronze free <a href="https://joincpi.org/video-classes">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
USACO online judge only accepts C/C++, Java or Python but what I do is I experiment and write out solutions first in my language of choice then translate that to C++ seeing how fast of a solution I can write. The specific language details are at the bottom <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions">here</a> we can use C/C++17, Java 11, Python 3.6 and old Python 2.7. I'm going to use their official online IDE if you want to run it locally install the same compilers they use in a virtual machine or install GNU Guix which allows for multiple versions of compilers/environments to be installed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>C++ versions</b>
</p>


<p>
C++ has versions C++98/03/11/14/17/20/23/26 these all represent years a new standard was released but that doesn't mean everyone implements the entire standard in their compiler. The current state of C++20/23/26 or 'modern' C++ is you can kind of do functional programming with it. Options, lambdas, higher-order functions, monads and more all now exist in the definition depending on which compiler you use. Google has <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/difficulties_improving_cpp.md">rage quit</a> C++ and is writing their own replacement called <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">Carbon</a> and as a result, clang/llvm has not even implemented the entire C++20 spec. I think only GCC or the GNU compiler collection implements C++23 features.

<h3 id="org0f54ff4">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f54ff4">
<p>
The first resource we can use where 'running time' is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source code. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do multiple rounds of a linear algorithm cleaning up the graph because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
O(g(x)) represents an upper bound for all functions in the family g(x). It doesn't represent growth since f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. A function n or f(n) is bounded by n, n<sup>2</sup> and n<sup>n</sup> that's why it's <i>an</i> upper bound not <i>the</i> upper bound as there's many upper bounds but we'd like the closest fitting bound.
</p>

<p>
If the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' then n is used instead of x in f(n) and all algorithm analysis you are generally assuming some kind of infinite inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.  
</p>

<p>
There is many more like little-o (strictly less than), big-Omega (strictly greater than), or big-Theta \(\theta(n)\) which describes a tight lower and upper bound. For example a program that searches a single list for a specific element is going to be at least a lower bound of O(n) because it has to look at everything once and no more than O(n) in the worst case scenario where the item is not found and the entire list is exhausted so it is \(\theta(n)\).

<h3 id="orgce2fd21">Time complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgce2fd21">
<p>
Skim through <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze/time-comp">time complexity</a>. Sign up to <a href="https://joincpi.org/video-classes">here</a> where all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEriEvhS48">videos</a> are. Watching the video he explains the 4 suggested resources:
</p>

<p>
First is 'IUSACO' 3-Algorithm Analysis <a href="https://darrenyao.com/usacobook/cpp.pdf#page=12">here</a>. It's only chapter 3 and 4 pages long. Explained in the video.
</p>

<p>
Next is 'CPH' 2-Time Complexity <a href="https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=27">here</a> from the competitive programming handbook. This is already known to us from the intro courses so let's look at 2.4 <i>Maximum subarray sum</i>. If it doesn't make sense it means which sequence or combination of neighboring elements produces the greatest sum. Try to solve this yourself before reading their solution. Remember you can prep something with multiple linear consecutive runs since O(n + n) is O(2n) which is of course O(n) and in this problem try removing the negative first and last array element since why would you keep them. The solution they give is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/">Kadane's Algorithm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Next is 'PAPS' 5-Time Complexity <a href="https://usaco.guide/PAPS.pdf#page=99">here</a> and the wall clock (using time() in the shell) is again mentioned but we'll learn you can't rely on wall clock time. Insertion sort we already did in the intro to CS courses where we learned for small data insert can be a constant operation. Page 91 he substituted t<sub>i</sub> for i and since this is a sum where the counter starts at 0, it's going to sum 0 + 1 + 2&#x2026; up to n - 1 times and we already know a sum from 1 to n closed form is (n + 1)n/2 or here (n - 1)n/2 but we can see the dominating power is going to be n<sup>2</sup> and this is followed by an example how n<sup>2</sup> is both an upper bound of n<sup>2</sup> and n. The proof of the bound first he noted that if you multiply N &gt;= 1 you get N<sup>2</sup> &gt;= N and this fact is used in the inequality something we will see in depth later.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUUkiEllHG0">video</a> they suggest goes through how to find function f(x) by analyzing the source. @11:03 remember you multiply everything in the body of a loop by the number of times you loop. Without doing any of the analysis I can immediately tell this is n * c * n<sup>3</sup> or n<sup>4</sup> but this becomes less obvious when objects are initialized in some library you called.

You can always first try and solve USACO bronze problems in your language of choice then translate the solution into optimized C++ when you think you have a solution and want to run it against the official testing. 
</p>

<p>
Reading through the <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze/intro-ds">intro to data structures</a> the writeup in USACO guide is all we will need for bronze problems but you may want to look through the slides of <a href="https://federico-busato.github.io/Modern-CPP-Programming/">Modern C++ Programming</a> by Federico Busato a senior developer at NVIDIA. USACO only allows up to C++17 features but he clearly labels what feature works with what version.

<h4 id="org586850e">Shell game</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org586850e">
<p>
The first problem is <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=891">shell game</a>. You have to make an account on USACO.org to submit entries here: <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php">https://usaco.org/index.php</a>
</p>

<p>
The sample input first line tells us how many times to loop input. Second line tells us shell 2 and 1 were swapped and the guess was 1. If the pebble was in 1 then the guess is incorrect as it swapped with 2. If the pebble was in 2 then the guess was correct. 
</p>

<p>
Write out some examples of keeping track of the state for all 3 potential initial pebble positions.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If pebble init 1 then 2, 3, 1</li>
<li>If pebble init 2 then 1, 1, 3</li>
<li>If pebble init 3 then 3, 2, 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
We only have to update whenever swap a or swap b equals the current position of any of the 3 initial positions. Here's some scratch work I did
</p>

<pre class="example">
Init swap array a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2, a[2] = 3
Init guess array g[0] = 0, g[1] = 0, g[2] = 0 
Loop array
 If swap1 = a[i] then a[i] = swap2
 If swap2 = a[i] then a[i] = swap1
 // after state change loop a again
 is guess = a[i]? increase g[i]
Return max of g
</pre>

<p>
This is where I know I'm probably not representing the optimal simulation because I have 2 if-statements and you always want to just do a single operation if you can not a pile of if's. I tried this solution and it worked all tests passed using 1.6mb of memory and 1ms execution time. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt; // needed for i/o
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // needed for max

int main() {
  // get the first line of input
 freopen("shell.in", "r", stdin);
 int n;
 scanf("%d", &amp;n);

 std::array&lt;int, 3&gt; state = {1, 2, 3};
 std::array&lt;int, 3&gt; guess{};

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
     int a, b, g;
     scanf("%d %d %d", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;g);
  for (int s = 0; s &lt; 3; s++) {
      if (a == state[s]) {state[s] = b;}
      else if (b == state[s]) {state[s] = a;}}
  for (int x = 0; x &lt; 3; x++) {
      if (g == state[x]) {guess[x]++;}}}

 freopen("shell.out", "w", stdout);
 printf("%d\n", std::max({guess[0], guess[1], guess[2]}));}
</pre>

<p>
Looking at their solution they accurately replicated the simulation while I hacked it. I have 2 nested loops but they only loop 3 times (constant) so my solution is n * c * c or nc which is O(n) as constants are ignored in Big-O. Their solution runs with 2.8mb memory and 2ms execution time so my hacked solution is faster for only 10 tests the server does. If I were to guess why I'm not simulating every swap only updating when the pebble is moved. 
</p>

<p>
You only have to include the file in/out if the problem statement asks for a file otherwise stdout can be used.

Second <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=855">problem</a> in USACO guide bronze. As usual write out examples to mimic the state transition but the problem statement has done that for us.

<li>the capacity bucket(next) - bucket(next) milk compared to the existing milk in bucket(n), take their min and adjust</li>

    std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; v;

	}
	
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
		int n = i % 3;  
		int next = (i+1) % 3;  
		int fill = std::min(v[n].second, v[next].first - v[next].second);

	}

	          &lt;&lt; v[1].second &lt;&lt; '\n'
		  &lt;&lt; v[2].second;
}
</pre>

<p>
My solution is similar to theirs except I made a pair data structure and stuffed it in a vector, and I used 'magic numbers' that's when you don't assign a constant variable where it only has to be changed in one place and there's just some magic number without documentation in the code. My solution uses 3.3mb memory and executes 2ms. Their solution is 3.4mb of memory and 2ms execution so I somehow beat them again but these are utterly worthless micro optimizations.

<h4 id="org78d46c6">Stuck in a Rut</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org78d46c6">
<p>
We may as well start with the hardest problem <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=1061">Stuck in a Rut</a> and work backward. This <i>seems</i> like an easy problem if we can identify why 2 cows will intersect. If you write out some examples to find some patterns these 2 cows eventually meet:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>north 11,2</li>
<li>east 10,4 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>initial state: (northx &gt; eastx), (northy &lt; easty).</li>
<li>meet in 2 or easty - northy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The first 2 cows in the sample input meet but at the same time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>north 5,3</li>
<li>east 3,5
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(northx &gt; eastx), (northy &lt; easty) and (northx = easty), (northy = eastx)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
First cow eventually crashes into something let's find out who
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>east 3,5
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>second cow has to be moving northx &gt; 3 and northy &lt; 5</li>
</ul></li>
<li>north 11,2 or north 8,1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>smaller northx hits the east 3,5 cow first</li>
<li>meet in 5 or northx - eastx</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Second cow eventually intersects:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>north 5,3
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>other cow had to be moving eastx &lt; 5, and easty &gt; 3</li>
</ul></li>
<li>east 4,6 or east 3,5 (equal so discarded)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>bigger eastx intersects first</li>
<li>meet in 3 or easty - northy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Compare all the north traveling cows compared to the east traveling cows, eliminating if (a,b = b,a), seeing if there is a pattern to the subtraction to find the exact meet, and whatever is left over test if it's movement is on the same y or x-axis, if not return infinity.  
</p>

<p>
Try the rest of the simulation problems there shouldn't be any surprise math here or anything and if the input space is small (unlike here with a billion possible x,y points) then you can do a full simulation mimicking the problem statement exactly.

You can see download the slides from the 2015 version of the course <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15251f15/schedule.html">here</a> which are very similar to what we are watching as there's sometimes errors in the recording where slides skip past too quickly. The Adjacency Matrix we haven't learned linear algebra yet but it's self-explanatory using his tiny graph of 4 edges as a reference where rows are left to right and columns are top to bottom. The lemma he walks through about connected components will come up in the 15-850 lectures. If it doesn't make sense see the slides for <i>Connectedness</i> where there is an 11 node graph, in 3 disconnected components. They are called 'connected components' but the 3 components are individual graphs they are not connected to each other they are connected internally meaning they are pieces of a larger graph sliced up. If you have 3 components and you add an edge from one component to another you now have 2 components. If you want the notes and some exercises/solutions to what we just watched see this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190426001152/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aada/courses/15251s18/www/notes.html">archive</a> from 2018.

First look at these <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> from 2023 titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i> it briefly explains how you go from brainstorming features of something you want to build into concepts.

Click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos.

Now we are going to take all the above introductions to conceptual design and rewrite the git interface to make it intuitive to use. We have to learn git anyway so may as well write a CLI (command line interface) or you could make it ridiculous and call it 'visual git' or something with DAG graphics.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>.

The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills).
