Here is everything I found that fits together to achieve the goal of being able to follow the <a href="https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/">people</a> who keep winning DEFCON and other CTFs so we can get good enough to eventually be paid to do this being a junior consultant and working our way up in the security industry which can be even more sketchy than old school blackhat communities. 
</p>

<p>
I mimic most of the security package at TU/e because all the most critical crypto/sec work is being done in Europe right now because of insane US laws on crypto software export. There is still an ongoing <a href="https://nist.pqcrypto.org/foia/index.html">lawsuit</a> by Daniel J Bernstein (djb) where the NSA/NIST is slowly delivering FOIA responses about sabotaging crypto development.

Everything here is practice with some reading and the recorded lectures if available are optional take what you want or start anywhere.

Selling <a href="https://www.crowdfense.com/exploit-acquisition-program/">exploits</a> for a lot of money. Some of these bounties are hilarious like only 100k for code signing bypass, it must be easier than it looks if it pays lower than a Wordpress exploit. They also really want a Docker escape vuln. <a href="https://zerodium.com/">Zerodium</a> is another broker and their <a href="https://zerodium.com/program.html">payouts chart</a> is supposedly market rates. The way this works is they pay you over time not all at once that way there's incentive for you to not turn around and resell to a competitor. 
</p>

<p>
If you can do this typically you will want to work for <a href="https://dfsec.com/">dfsec</a> they pay you a bonus for any major bug you find. It used to be you could just extract control-flow graphs and run a logical assistant on it finding any kind of potential attack avenues to try but I have no idea what they do these days but we'll find out as we go.

This is a wagie working shifts for a 24/7 (usually remotely) enterprise tier threat response contractor who is paid to anaylze system logs (almost always Windows OS logs) and analyze network traffic to spot problems. They have some kind of monitoring tools and you primarily extract and filter data with OSquery and do 'threat intelligence'. The curriculum we are already doing is more than enough to get into this or find some kind of learning path for SOC Level 1 and 2 but these almost always cost money. This is the only <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/cybersecurity/ibm-threat-intelligence-lifecycle-fundamentals">free course</a> (edx) I could find. This <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1">one</a> is the cheapest I could find it appears to be some subscription model of $14/m or you could simply use their syllabus to look up everything yourself like OSquery, wireshark, Snort, MITRE etc. Most people get into this via the military or were former system admins or pay for <a href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc">certs</a>. 
</p>

<p>
To find SOCs search for security operations center jobs or try Sophos or NCC Group (Netherlands or Philippines) these companies have to hire local citizens and can't outsource because of security clearances. I imagine these outfits exist so gov contractors and giant medical companies can satisfy some kind of insurance compliance or lawsuit protection from any breaches/leaked data. If you get in here you want to move up to running the place because they pay for all your silly certs and because every tech company will hire you as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) should you leave SOC work. Outside of finance and pharma/medical the CISO is usually given next to no budget and no authority you get paid a lot of money to sit on the executive board while answering emails and making presentations it's a ceremonial job almost where you hire the same SOC you used to work for and then play golf or whatever CISO's actually do all day.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4541ea1">
<p>
Someone charging 7-20k+ per week for an application security assessment. This kind of person can do the 'full stack' of security review from source code review/dependencies to secOps deployment to how developers handle the keys for signing into the source repository. With large security consulting outfits the typical engagement is 2-3 consultants for 2 weeks where there is juniors competent in running security procedures like penetration testing and the principal consultant oversees them and presents all the reports the juniors produced justifying the money spent. On large contracts they will outsource reverse engineers and all kinds of other specialists charging insanely high hourly rates. The major outfits are Leviathan security, IOactive, Bishop Fox, NCC group, Crowdstrike (if they are still in business after that parser being exploitable and not verifying inputs blew up the whole world) or search for security consultant jobs. Leviathan is probably the biggest in the US because I believe you have to contract either them and/or Bishop Fox in order use any kind of Google auth in your software. They even sell a 'virtual CISO' <a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/services/risk-advisory-services/virtual-chief-information-security-officer">service</a>. If these outfits aren't hiring send in a general application or email them and say you want to apprentice showing them some kind of proof of your skills like custom tools you wrote or something.

Immediately npm breaches is brought up, the JavaScript package manager. If you've ever installed some Node.js software to run it locally you will have noticed there's hundreds of dependencies being automatically installed. If you missed the attack description the stream dependency was attacked to specifically target some Bitcoin wallet software in hopes that the wallet developers themselves would include it in their builds and they did. All the attacker had to do was find some unmaintained but popular dependency and took over the entire project. Many browser plugins have had this happen too, either sold to adtech or malware writers or they helpfully take over the abandoned project. 
</p>

<p>
@9:00 we're getting into nightmare scenario where VSCode the IDE most developers use is now compromised. The point is some dependency nobody pays attention to got turned into malicious code and found it's way into almost every critical program on earth.

@19:50 the seemingly benign software you find in the wild like adding colors to your terminal or javascript console is actually filled with malware of course but you probably knew that already. Famously this was almost all the flashlight/torch apps on app store before they cracked down.

He talks about SELinux also known as MAC or mandatory access controls like AppArmor. MAC is something enterprise security people love because it's knob tweaking but state can become so complex in modern systems you cannot guarantee your policy doesn't allow illicit states without some kind of logical assistant to model everything and run tests on. Whenever you search for AppArmor or SELinux the number one recommendation or most-searched for query is <i>how to turn it off</i> because it's intefering in someone's work and in the real world that's what everyone does.

@5:10 is very interesting.

Now cancelled former Tor developer and 'Wikileaks associate' Jacob Appelbaum quietly got a PhD from two of the world's premiere crypto experts DJ Bernstein and Tanja Lange at TU/e in the Netherlands. I don't know or care about any of the details of his fall from grace but he did write a thesis/dissertation so we may as well read it. The pdf is <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/communication-in-a-world-of-pervasive-surveillance-sources-and-me">here</a> or direct link <a href="https://research.tue.nl/files/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Skimming the intro this is more of a political manifesto instead of a thesis I'm surprised the school didn't demand he remove a lot of cringe here. In the section he calls bad mathematics he shames on cruise control others who take fed cash yet seems completely unaware he once worked for the Tor Project which is funded by US <a href="https://support.torproject.org/misc/misc-3/">federal agencies</a> like the DoD. If you follow DJ Bernstein then you know he amusingly rants on the IETF crypto working group mailing list whenever some stooge proposes yet another badly designed or patent trolled elliptic curve scheme so that to me is the definition of 'bad mathematics' trying to sneak in broken by design protocols. In 1.2 <i>Thinking about the future</i> some of the claims derived from the questionable sources he lists are so wild even Wikipedia jannies wouldn't have green lighted this so I skipped most of it but the theme as far I can tell is crypto still works if it's designed/used correctly. 
</p>

<p>
Section 2 <i>Background on network protocols</i> skimming this quickly OpenVPN is demonized as being the target of NSA weakening but OpenVPN code is so ridiculously bad and convoluted that they probably didn't really have to do anything nefarious to it except promote it's use. 
</p>

<p>
Section 3 <i>Background on cryptography</i> if you look at Tanja Lange's <a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/tanja/teaching/pqcrypto22/">crypto course</a> page she recommends for general background this free online <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">book</a> so we can refer to it as we very lightly read this section. The <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf">hash functions</a> chapter a hash function h maps bit-strings of arbitrary but finite length to strings of fixed length so the domain of the function (inputs) maps to a range (outputs) that is many-to-one as the inputs are larger than the range so there exists the possibility of collisions where 2 distinct pairs of inputs have the same output. Now you know how password hashing works, the hashes map to a plain text input but the Appelbaum thesis notes these password hash functions are designed to be extremely slow by purposely running inefficient calculations that require large amounts of contiguous memory so you can't easily brute force the hash by bombing it with millions of strings to guess passwords. 
</p>

<p>
Block ciphers <a href="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap7.pdf">chapter</a> seems to be a function that accepts as input a n-bit sized vector of plaintext and a key vector then a product transformation occurs to create ciphertext that is the same size of the input. If the input exceeds the size of the n-bit block then it's partitioned into same size blocks and encrypted seperately using a mode of operation to do so one old example is ECB or electronic-codebook mode. A symmetric key is shared via some Diffie-Hellman like public key system we can learn later. The term 'nonce bit' is called IV or initialization vector in older books. Djb's ChaCha20 high speed crypto and Poly1305 MAC is mentioned and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539">detailed here</a> if interested. Skimming the rest of this chapter there's an interesting comment about NIKE or non-interactive key exchange that has a deniability property where finding encrypted content that decrypts with someone else's key is still not definitive proof of any communication between each other. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 4 you probably already know most of this if you read the Snowden leaks and 2017 Wikileaks CIA files and there's a bunch of material here in this chapter on glowie PSYOPS strategies all laid out in chronological order. Applebaum goes totally off the rails again back into political manifesto territory. A lot of content is straight up ranting but the later content going through all known shady nation state malware and explaining how it works is worth reading. Even though a lot of these exploit 'products' in the leaked ANT catalog are from 10 years ago I doubt much has changed especially what data they were after so the methods change but the target is the same. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 5 GNU naming system has a good crash course on how DNS works. The NSA shenanigans detailed here are amusing they ran some global monitoring bot network to hide their DNS queries after an attack to admire their work and avoid blame. GNS is a <a href="https://docs.gnunet.org/latest/users/gns.html">GNUnet</a> app which I like way more than all the blockchain nonsense going on right now requiring massive amounts of mining. Note to self look into GNUnet more.   
</p>

<p>
Chapter 6 WireGuard tweak it only works for some future quantum adversary meaning if traffic is vacuumed up and held to be broken years later then this tweak works otherwise an active quantum adversary you have to redesign the entire WireGuard protocol. That's if quantum computers aren't a total scam every company in the field always makes suspect promises of massive amounts of qbits then nothing happens. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 7 Vula has code to read <a href="https://vula.link/">here</a> and is developed anonymously obviously because of Appelbaum's pariah status. I'll have to come back here after we get familiar with post quantum crypto an automatic LAN encrypting scheme is a pretty awesome idea.

<h2 id="orgb770878">The real history of h4xxing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb770878">
<p>
In the early days you basically stumbled into hacking/phreaking by accident by either curious discovery pressing a combo of commands or blew a Cap'n Crunch free cereal box whistle into the phone handset and gained complete control over the system. Techniques were traded for free there was no real security industry for software or even much organized criminal activity until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker_Crackdown">hacker crackdown</a>. Most crime was stealing technical manuals and juvenile pranks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet">EFnet</a> rivals was typical in the 90s or getting the numbers to a group of payphones in NYC, figuring out how to call them for free, and some other hacker would answer and give you advice where to find information. That was the scene then a bunch of 'keyboard cowboys' and around this time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33WuGp6fs3s">Hackers the movie</a> came out which besides the (fruit boots) inline skates was very realistic it should almost be a documentary like how you'd go to meets and they'd drill you what do you actually know. 
</p>

<p>
Post Kevin Mitnic conviction in the late 90s to mid 2000s this changed to a blackhat culture where cloning SIM cards, cracking copyright protections and releasing pirate software (warez scene) took over spawning a binary exploitation/reverse engineering and remote box popping culture that still exchanged ideas and software for free but quickly a marketplace emerged for the purposes of jacking financial data and 0day auctions started springing up in the underground. That card scene only had a very few actual hackers grabbing databases or sniffing wireless point of sale for the most part the people involved were just common identity thieves who purchased devices to place on ATMs or hired staff to double swipe cards at restaurants and airports. 
</p>

<p>
Today these criminals have an opposite strategy of trying to not get noticed instead of withdrawing millions in a single night from globals ATMs and alerting Interpol of their existence they now charge micro transactions on hundreds of thousands of cards in hopes the mark doesn't notice but that's still not hacking it's just ID theft.
</p>

<p>
Anonymous was the 'hive' it was a large group of kids willing to use the tools that blackhats gave them either for lelz or in order to cover for whatever they had just done with the same tool. "Damn this attack signature is too unique I'm going to get caught for sure! Wait I know who to blame for this the hacker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGvhIBHnJM">known as&#x2026;</a>"

RMS spent two entire years reverse engineering software that took a team of people to write all the while routinely breaking into the lab servers and rewriting all the passwords to be blank so no student would be spied on by the administration. Up until MIT kicked him out a few years ago he was still hacking their security system cloning his own access pass to campus so he could come and go anonymously.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Huntley_Watt">Stephen Huntley Watt</a> is the only convicted blackhat who never snitched. 
</p>

<p>
He was one of the most famous blackhats of the 2000s because of PR0J3KT M4YH3M a war against the whole so-called white hat industry. There was an anti-sec movement back then claiming that disclosure sites like bugtraq, security conferences and anti-virus corporations were creating the problem they were paid to solve by dumping what is essentially nuclear weapons to masses of global criminals free of charge. A classic method that still works today is simply run a diff on whatever bugtraq or other disclosed patch to reveal the exploit then write up a turn-key h4xxoring product and sell it on skiddy forums as it would take months or sometimes years for people to update their systems so unpatched systems were wide open. "Better hire us to protect you" these outfits would claim while at the same time creating chaos by arming everyone on earth. Even the modern day Pwn2Own competitions have this problem where there is a patch gap between Chrome and Chromium being patched so some have noticed the exploits from Pwn2Own will still work for some period after especially on any headless instance of these browsers because they run outside the usual browser sandbox.
</p>

<p>
A lot of project mayhem is detailed in ~el8 <a href="http://web.textfiles.com/ezines/EL8/">text files</a> from 2001-2002 which are written in a style that you would expect from juvenile blackhats back then where they attacked every known white hat and company in the security industry and somehow avoided prison. They even super trolled Theo De Raadt who is also known (back then) as one of the most trollastic open source devs but today I am thankful OpenBSD still exists it's a nice clean OS where you can understand everything that is going on.
</p>

<p>
He was making a nice salary in NYC as a trading systems software developer (at now called <a href="https://tsimagine.com/">tsImagine</a>) and gave away for free a packet sniffing program to a fellow blackhat he knew since high school because that's how the hacker scene used to work you never charged money to other hackers. Anyway that other blackhat did a really stupid crime with it and snitched where he got the program from so Watt spent 2 years in fed prison for a writing a single packet sniffer. He claimed on is Xwitter the only way he could get a job despite being one of the best hackers on earth was to apply to a Ukraine company after prison and if you search around they are desperate for foreign remote devs in Kiev because of the war. Last I heard he still owes the US gov $170m+ and works for DomainTools as a principle software engineer. If there exists a hall of fame for blackhats he should be in it.

</div>

<p>
The courts declared Max a 'super hacker' who was so good the judge at his trial called him 'the hacker of all hackers' and gave him way less time than normal out of pure shock for his skill. There's an entire book about this guy worth reading because he took over the entire underground market in a single night breaking into the 4 biggest competitor markets and stealing their databases of users, emailing all users that they should join his site instead and shutting his competition down. Some of these sites touted their uber security like requiring a special signed cert handed out only to a few people to even connect to the server and of course he got those certs and broke in. His demise began when one of the sites he usurped was a federal sting site and the feds weren't too happy about him taking it over. 
</p>

<p>
Max although on supervised release now is still facing new charges claiming he used a phone at the prison to 'control drones and drop contraband in the prison' which is of course almost surely nonsense. Personal experience tells me there was probably some guy Max played cards with who pestered Max to tell him how some crime like that could work then when he got caught he of course snitched on the bigger fish like all these guys do. 
</p>

<p>
Max used a lot of tricks like hiding his very popular marketplace in plain site so ISPs couldn't find him. I'll write about this later but I suspect he modified protocols such as changing the rounds in ssh so any kind of scanning would render his market invisible. He then could camoflauge the traffic as normal network traffic.

There is a hacker called ASTRA who was revealed to be a 58 year old retired mathematician living in Greece. He remotely broke into France's Dassault corporation which manufactures military aircraft and weapons and sold secrets worth 350 million dollars from 2002 until 2008 to their competitors worldwide with the help of a global crime network. He was clearly not an employee leaking information or anything or else he'd be in prison and his identity revealed. Nobody has ever revealed his identity because he likely was hacking OpenSSL or something they deemed too important to not know about so retained him as a consultant. He was living under <i>perfectly forged</i> gov identities in Athens that he had hacked (again prob OpenSSL or other crypto hacking breaking into gov dbms) and they never revealed how they caught him though likely it was following money or a lesser guy in his crime network was picked up and snitched.

I don't recognize his aliases from back in the day and there is def some ppl I remember like one mod on a popular market you probably know about that had a confused looking John C Reilly avatar who got away scott free through pure stupidity living up to his avatar. They revealed in court docs a failed sting they had set up for him twice to pick up money they sent to him from a compromised site admin account but he was so incompetent he went to the wrong address both times. He's too stupid to catch.

<p>
Bruce Schneier has a good article about crime how that criminals never use probability to estimate the cost of their actions or if the crime they're about to do is worth betting on. In finance you are always estimating the expected value of some game strategy and deciding if it's worth the risk. 
</p>

<p>
Many of these markets are busted because of the greed of the operators of course and because they seem to have faith in crypto marketing that is only marketing. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer%27s_Market">The Farmers Market</a> used Hushmail so an entire archive of decrypted messages was available to the feds. Old blackberry phones used to be sold with 'unbreakable encryption' too but you could easily compromise the server and get all the keys. 
</p>

<p>
@15:50 is the fallacy 'how they screwed up' because if you read anything here so far you realize that it's impossible not to screw up the global surveillance capabilities are just too advanced and corrupt now you would need to have a fail safe plan of living in a country with non-extradition where you also enjoy local political status like you are the mayor's son or police chief's cousin. If you don't have political cover then these foreign nations phone your local police dept about you and they arrive to shake you down for money. 
</p>

<p>
@19m some good advice here but again using whatever meme OS like Whonix is not your most critical attack vector it's people you know in real life or trying to cash out money.  
</p>

<p>
@26:49 Sabu the guy in lulzsec was busted after he got wasted and accidentally signed in under a watched nym to some chat channel without using his normal protections. What was critical about that is they already knew who he was through means not disclosed and were watching him from a near by parking lot when he handed over a fool proof warrant for his apartment by logging in with his home ISP address. 
</p>

<p>
@29m this is the problem with this kind of activity is you can't really convert it to pay yourself on the scale of cash flows needed for trafficking. I'm sure you can think of ways you believe have never been tried before and will totally fool advanced analysis that looks for these patterns but there is no such thing as original ideas how to launder money that's why elaborate global crime networks are used. Many countries have laws how much of their currency you can remove like China so their rich overseas residents will buy up foreign currency from traffickers then settle within the Chinese banking system so the traffickers get cleaned money and the millionaire residents get foreign exchange.   
</p>

<p>
@33m he redpills that all the message forum style lawyers are wrong because the feds simply lie to someone you know that they have to talk or else and they don't even need to have witnessed a crime just confirm certain movements on certain days in court where the feds present this as proof of furtherence of a conspiracy.

End of this he warns it's a bad business model doing what he did and the return on investment is never enough for the risk. Making a lot of money legally is not impossible. Let's say you finish this security workshop here and are hired as a junior consultant somewhere being paid a $40k yearly bonus which is typical. In 2 years you can put a down payment on a house with just your bonus. Every year you take the same bonus and add value by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPpwulZVFik">Scuffed Realtor</a> or some other YouTube live to learn proper landscaping and kitchen redesign. In 5 years you will have added $200k worth of quality work and maybe you now have a familiy and need a bigger house so can sell making a nice return on your investment. Now you can afford a down payment on much more valuable property and repeat until you have an asset portfolio worth a million dollars. Note you aren't flipping houses and speculating on real estate you are investing in your life during different stages. This is how people build wealth in the modern world they don't become criminals or gamble on meme coins.

This is just reading notes/slides and doing some exercises to learn loop invariants and reasoning about code so we can break it. We also need the information here to do 15-213 the x86-64 architecture course and later the operating systems course.

First let's get c0 programming language (pronounced c-naught or c-not) by installing it <a href="https://bitbucket.org/c0-lang/docs/wiki/Downloads">here</a>. Use can use any text editor, you either compile a c0 program to a binary and run it or you use coin interpreter see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Are6AK5Nn4">setup video</a> and skip to @8m 'Running a c0 program'. You can also use various editor plugins. If you use VScode it's in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=15122staff.c0-lsp">marketplace</a> if you use emacs like me they have a c0-mode but I'm just going to manually run everything mostly in coin.
</p>

<p>
The first lecture if you downloaded everything contains mystery2.c0
</p>

<pre class="example">
/* Mystery function with a bug or two
 *
 * 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation
 * Frank Pfenning
 */

int f (int x, int y) {
  int r = 1;
  while (y &gt; 1) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      r = x * r;
    }
    x = x * x;
    y = y / 2;
  }
  return r * x;
}
</pre>

<p>
Type 'coin mystery2.co' and you get the c0 interpreter. Inside the interpreter enter f(3,2); (note the semicolon) and press return to see it evaluated. To exit Ctrl-D which is the universal exit command for any Unix/Linux shell program meaning 'end of input' or type #quit. This is all in their <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s15/lab/lab0.pdf">setup lab</a> or the video I posted above. The c0.typesafety.net domain is long gone.

Reading the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/handouts/lectures/01-contracts.pdf">first lecture</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/handouts/slides/review/01-contracts.pdf">slides</a> from this year's version. They are both worth looking at, the notes are like a book and slides have some additional content aimed at students like 'why is this bad code'. Sometimes they erase semesters if so try and earlier one linked above. Like we did in setup paste that mystery program to test.c0 and load it in coin and try it out with inputs as per lecture notes. In <i>Finding a Loop Invariant</i> the exit condition in the while loop is (y &gt; 1) and you think about what the value of all mutable assignables are right before that exit condition is tested. 
</p>

<p>
If you get a strange error note how the scope bracket { comes after the pre/post conditions and invariant: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
int POW (int x, int y)
//@requires y &gt;= 0;
{
  if (y == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return x * POW(x, y-1);
}

int f (int x, int y) 
  //@requires y &gt;= 0;
  //@ensures \result == POW(x,y);
{
  int r = 1;
  int base = x; 
  int exp = y;
  while (exp &gt; 1)
    //@loop_invariant r * POW(base,exp) == POW(x,y);
    {
    if (exp % 2 == 1) {
      r = base * r;
    }
    base = base * base;
    exp = exp / 2;
  }
  return r * base;
}
</pre>

<p>
Page 24, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegerDivision.html">integer division</a> 1/2 is 0: (2*n+1)/2 is 2*n/2 + 1/2 or n + 0. Page 25, the antecedent in an implication: If (antecedent) then (consequent) which returns a t/f boolean.
</p>

<p>
This was a very detailed logical look at a simple function and in the end it still wasn't correct because we hit int max and overflowed into undefined behavior. If none of the syntax makes sense like compound assignments in the exercises then look at the c0 <a href="https://c0.cs.cmu.edu/docs/c0-reference.pdf">reference</a> under 'Commands'.

There is a problem with the book where the global version the publisher paid someone to screw with the practice problems and many of the solutions in the book are wrong. The only decent pdf you can find is the global version too I don't think they have a US electronic version. I bought the global version for I think $20 and the actual chapter contents are identical it's only many of the early exercises I find that were bungled. You can use library genesis to get an OCR'd copy but they are all gigantic in size see this <a href="http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=A665E0B6F83F9FE49120BE27F3A85902">upload</a> where the Chinese uploader describes all the versions available. However does it really matter? If there's a practice problem translating C to assembly we can always generate the unoptimized assembly with the compiler and verify it ourselves or figure out easily any hex to binary solution.

The lectures are definitely helpful for this course because the book is filled with so many details you can easily get lost but it's up to you.
