I assume you are teaching yourself at the same time some kind of intro course you found on YouTube or a book somebody recommended such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Functional CS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/sicp.html">SICP</a></li>
<li>anything</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is under construction as I have to work on it a few hours a day until it's finished. Some days I have time and others I don't, you should take this for fun and not worry if nothing makes sense right away it never does but in time you'll probably be better than me at this. 
</p>

<p>
I am often in contact with recruiters in finance and ask them what exactly do you want for 'new grads' or entry-level candidates. People in this work are writing trading optimizers to lower fees on trades, low-latency network software, and making models faster for quant researchers that process unthinkably huge amounts of proprietary data feeds.  The answer is always a solid grasp of algorithms, memory and concurrency models, CPU-architecture, operating systems and databases. If you show competency in most of the above then you can be taught everything else and you're in. Everything here was vetted by them as being desirable as a basic foundation for someone who doesn't have a degree: USACO training, PLAI.org programming language memory models, queueing theory, and Andy Pavlo's CMU course which teaches how modern high performance applications are designed. 
</p>

<p>
The interviews for these roles are often a single zoom call with a request to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> and seeing if you even bother asking questions to clarify the requirements or write examples of edge cases to see how careless you are as a developer because mistakes cost money. This is essentially the new fizz buzz filter. After expect to be asked about your chosen language's memory model and any jargon you use they will ask to define it on the spot to catch you bluffing. If you have a solid set of credentials and pass this part that's basically it and you're in. However if you are a risk to them with questionable credentials or none at all then expect a longer interview with a collaborative design of a deceptively simple interface like a controller for a game. The task is then to optimize this design and justify each stage of optimization such as knowing about elementary queuing theory techniques to reduce wait times. They will ask can your code take better advantage of cache locality and avoid calling into the object cache and missing then having to allocate a new object on the heap during a loop. How would you test this code, how would you review this code if someone gave it to you, would you feel confident putting this in production right now? Nothing impossible that you can't teach yourself with some practice. They want to see what you are like to work with when trying to collaborate on solving a problem and that you possess a motivation for learning. If you find them asking you about math or things you didn't put on your resume it's because they think you can do another role like quant trading which pays more.

Campus recruiting used to be available but is getting more monopolized by big corps or shady outfits that manipulate school guidelines by pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) so it is a struggle to find anyone qualified to do this kind of work. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies that want them further draining the hiring and internship pool. That means there's opportunities for us to weasel ourselves in through sheer determination.

There will be much more than this such as software design but here is a brief choose your own adventure.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACO guide</a> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>w/ optional <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-851-advanced-data-structures-spring-2012/pages/assignments/">data structures</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15850/">algorithm design</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6506-s23/">algorithm engineering</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The USACO guide is excellent at preparing you for any kind of algorithmic test filtering companies may do and it's completely free.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A workbook on <a href="https://www.plai.org/">languages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Explains that almost all industry popular languages are virtually identical and demystifies all the OOP jargon. It's a workbook we use a web-based <a href="https://github.com/LuKuangChen/stacker-2023">stacker</a> to see exactly how programs execute.    
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/Probability/book.html">Queueing theory</a> and probability models</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you write enough software eventually you discover that almost everything is some kind of queue pattern. This is another workbook that's Q&amp;A style not a giant theory text.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/">Advanced DBMS (OLAP)</a> system design for analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we learn kernel bypass methods for low latency networking, code profiling and optimization, hashing/join algorithms, search space complexity reduction, and modern distributed application architecture like microservices. We can also look at their AI tuning <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/">seminar</a> for relational dbms optimization knob tuning. You can use any language here you'd like.

You never sell yourself as a junior. Companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the simple technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed in the industry even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer.  
</p>

<p>
There are many non-finance companies that prefer to hire on-site junior developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and mentor them to senior developers. One is in New Hampsire (near Boston) called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. They use <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.102/www/sp24/">TypeScript</a> which if you've done <a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a> or even <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">Functional CS</a> will be trivial for you to pick up. The workbook at plai.org will also teach you the memory model of the JS language. 
</p>

<p>
If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer. 
</p>

<p>
If you contribute to open source projects you will pick up work for example while writing this workshop I tried out contributing to <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/">Blender</a> then made a LinkedIn profile claiming to be a self-taught student and C++ developer with a single pull request for a feature written from scratch as my portfolio. Numerous local gaming companies tried to recruit me shortly after saying they would train. LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> I've only ever used it to harvest recruiter offers.
</p>

<p>
You can also approach whoever you think is the best local developer and simply ask for work to do. Open source software is easiest if not you contact someone in your community either through a meetup, hackathon, or email and ask for tasks to do saying you want to learn it all from scratch. If you are remote they are reluctant to work with you but if you both live in the same city and can meet up once in a while that makes them trust you more. Once you are in all you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually start paying you once you have proven to be indispensible. Even better if they get promoted you get promoted. If they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. If they get hired at a top trading firm everyone says you have no chance of getting into guess who they will tell the hiring managers they should also hire. 
</p>

<p>
I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and tried it out internally after being hired to write software. I started frequenting the area where all the money was being made by people with fancy degrees and asked for things to do until the work became sophisticated enough they wanted to move me in there with them. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you sell yourself to them that you are serious about being mentored they will tell management to make it happen.

The best way to learn is to start <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests">here</a> and try solving the bronze level problems in each contest.
</p>

<p>
Use the following as needed: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze/">USACO guide</a> bronze chapter</li>
<li>The set of videos for bronze <a href="https://joincpi.org/video-classes">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Each problem has all the test data included to test your own solution and a full writeup often containing a proof why the solution is correct. We will learn how to write these proofs. Do these in your language of choice. If you want to submit entries to the online judge (you don't have to) make an account on USACO.org here: <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php">https://usaco.org/index.php</a>  
</p>

<p>
Instead of having the online judge report our memory usage and runtime we can figure out how to do this ourselves.

<p>
<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.

A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember if debugging and believing your solution still isn't optimized enough.

<b>C++ versions</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm probably going to do all the problems in OCaml or Scheme. If you want to submit entries in C++ and are curious about versions like C++98/03/11/14/17/20/23/26 these all represent years a new standard was released but that doesn't mean every compiler implements the entire standard. Google has <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/difficulties_improving_cpp.md">rage quit</a> C++ and is writing their own replacement called <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">Carbon</a> and as a result clang/llvm has not even implemented the entire C++20 spec. I think only GCC or the GNU compiler collection implements C++23 features. The best source I have found is the slides of <a href="https://federico-busato.github.io/Modern-CPP-Programming/">Modern C++ Programming</a> by Federico Busato a senior developer at NVIDIA. USACO only allows up to C++17 features but he clearly labels what feature works with what version.

<h3 id="orgc4456ad">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc4456ad">
<p>
The first resource we can use where 'running time' is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

I'm only going to do the Bronze competition problems <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests">here</a> from past contests. They include solutions and all the test data so can use any language you want. 
</p>

<p>
Give a quick look through the USACO guide for bronze. If you've forgotten what n choose k is look it up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9txb9FgLDNY">YouTube</a> but we probably won't need it for any of the bronze problems except that one example in the guide for backtracking. The only thing to know about this chapter is there are 2 problem solving strategies introduced: complete search (brute force) and greedy. Brute force is self-explanatory (try all possible solutions) and greedy strategy you likely remember from Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm taught in any introductory CS course where the algorithm always makes the 'best' choice locally. Start anywhere in the graph and always take the path that is the least weight.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. It used to be called 6.170 before MIT renumbered every course recently. Universities always do ridiculous things every 3-5 years it's like some new dean comes in and demands oh we have to reinvent everything and buy all new (awful) edtech. 
</p>

<p>
First look at these <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">slides</a> from 2023 titled <i>Diverge-Converge</i> it briefly explains how you go from brainstorming features of something you want to build into concepts. 
</p>

<p>
Click <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a>, skip the 'message of the day', and scroll to the very bottom of the materials list where there are 6 lecture videos. They are all worth watching but we are interested in the two lectures on conceptual design. Watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzAbrqk9LNLhGMLbsTuVgAm6p9_Do_Ux/view?usp=sharing">lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ85ui0k2QpCKgfJZXUPSk-jdSi36MzP/view?usp=sharing">lecture 2</a>. Look at the recent <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L4.pdf">slides</a>. You have surely encountered badly designed software and this is a way to model your ideas as state machines then synch them together to compose an application that people can actually understand how to use. If you don't understand what you just looked at don't worry we'll be implementing it in full you will get it.

Now we are going to take all the above introductions to conceptual design and rewrite the git interface to make it intuitive to use. We have to learn git anyway so may as well write a CLI (command line interface) or you could make it ridiculous and call it 'visual git' or something with DAG graphics.  
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to a file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development.     
</p>

<p>
Let's learn what git actually is by watching MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i>. Lecture starts ~7m in. So far the data structure and model is trivial to understand if you did any intro course here such as <a href="./accelerated.html">CS19</a> learnings about DAGs. 
</p>

<p>
Proceed to <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> and navigate to research or <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> page on MIT's software design group. You will find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XZYMjg93o">this</a> talk about the problems with git design. The guy giving this talk was the PhD student of the prof we watched in the conceptual design lectures and now is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.getaleph.com/careers">Aleph</a> some fintech data startup (which is hiring, maybe you can impress him with your conceptual design skills).
