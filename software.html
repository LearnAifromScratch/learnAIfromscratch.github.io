<h4 id="org1912fc0">Finance jobs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1912fc0">
<p>
I often meet up with software <a href="https://joveinternational.com/markets-coverage/">recruiters</a> in finance who tell me a tale of woe how much harder it's become to find candidates so I asked them what exactly do you want these days for a basic new grad style candidate and would they look at resumes without a degree. The following curriculum is a result of these conversations which are ongoing as I've been toying with the idea <i>can I teach someone to do what we do here from scratch</i> so they don't have to spend $90k or whatever the total cost is now for an undergrad at even a public university. I have no intention of creating a new filter or mandatory hoop people must jump through this is simply a collection of free materials to optionally take if you don't have a degree.    
</p>

<p>
The recruiters told me if they could find a non-degree candidate that knows the entire CPU-arch execution pipeline and can answer any question about how an eviction from the cache might happen (like mutating state/hash collision) then they get a point. If they know a language extremely well like they've been using it everyday and can explain how it abstracts the memory including it's managed runtime if it has one then that's another point. If they have provable problem solving skills typically taught by competitive programming where given a seemingly impossible problem the candidate can at least work to a non-optimized solution without immediately giving up then that's another point. Finally if they can do all of the above with a very high standard of code quality then that is the perfect introductory candidate who can be taught anything else needed and they should be contacting recruiters asap. All of the above is not impossible to teach yourself so I will do just that here to prove it can be done. 
</p>

<p>
There's many reasons why you'd want to work for <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisaycock/8b7a37b1f97549517cb7789be5b06266">trading firms</a>. Most of them are in Chicago and trading firms like Valkyrie will hire <a href="https://www.valkyrietrading.com/careers/junior-software-engineer/">juniors</a> explicitly but the rest of them will too depending how good you are. You don't have to live downtown either, South side Chicago is still a comfy working class community and Blue Island is full of local rowdy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfLpgTy1w7M">bands</a> you won't have any problems there. My reasons for working in finance are paid education. You get paid to go from technician to the Formula 1 race car engineer of software.

<h4 id="org16dfe83">The work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org16dfe83">
<p>
Imagine all software bespoke from the server metal up where you are expected to quickly learn everything about L1/L2 caches and Intel features like Intel RDT (CAT,CMT) or Processor Trace. Not all the work is pure optimization these big funds now have large suites of custom client software and even roll their own internal email, code review software, even the compiler is almost entirely custom where I work. SQL queries are done using a DSL, the provenance of data is tracked with custom software, tl;dr everything is made in-house so you are always reinventing something from scratch. You typically start out working at the beginning of the critical path where hundreds of paid data feeds are coming in continuously or as a massive end of trading day dump in sizes you thought could only be fictional. One example is those 'no fee trading' middle-man brokerages like Robinhood they are selling their entire order book to a major HFT firm meaning someone had to write the entire execution pipeline that order book to be processed within microseconds.

<h4 id="org2e0f694">Recruiters</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2e0f694">
<p>
Jove Intl, <a href="https://oxfordknight.co.uk/jobs/">Oxford Knight</a>, Reload Search, and ex-employees who have quit to become highly paid one-man recruiting shops most of whom are the one's I've been talking to after running into them at bars after work and at events. They hire internationally for Chicago, NYC, Austin, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Shanghai, Tokyo and now Singapore seems to be the location everyone is opening offices these days. If you include certain keywords on your LinkedIn like C++ these independents will find you though yes I also think LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S3Hg191Eu0">trash</a> I've only ever used it to harvest recruiter offers.

<h4 id="org81be8e8">Selection</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org81be8e8">
<p>
They go over all resumes there's no automated ATS or applicant tracking system. USACO training stands out, so-called modern C++ meaning C++17/20/23 stands out but is not necessary as any firm will train you. You never sell yourself as a junior, companies will hire anyone who knows how to sell themselves and can pass the technical competence filters. You always pretend to be employed writing software even if this means setting up a personal page declaring yourself a freelancer on Upwork actively looking for contract work which is exactly what we'll do here.

<div id="outline-container-orge9729e2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge9729e2">Campus recruiting</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge9729e2">
<p>
Getting more and more monopolized by big tech pressuring students with 2-week expiring offers (aka exploding offers) that are against campus hiring guidelines but they do it anyway. Professors sometimes act like recruiters now too receiving a form of commission setting up their students with companies further draining the hiring and internship pool. There is a lot of myths about working in finance too which prevents new grads applying but most of these are prop shops who invest only their own private funds where the profit is in identifying when a stock is priced lower than it should be then buying that stock to later make a profit once it inevitably rises. They call this 'fixing inefficiencies in the market' and it's much different than robber barons hedging bets against the success of companies like a small town mill to depress it's price then buying it cheap and holding a fire sale of all assets putting people out of work. You will know right away in the phone screen if you're being recruited to some kind of ghoulish fund like this but I've never seen them around.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6f7914e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6f7914e">Phone screens</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6f7914e">
<p>
I don't know if they still do this but one Chicago company was notorious for firing off 3 problems to solve on Hackerrank seconds after you submitted an application. The first phone screen is usually a recruiter asking are you legal to work and if not what credentials do you have because in some countries like the US you will need a reason for them to issue you a work visa for a job that can't be given to a local so a degree or equivalent work experience. If they want you they'll finesse these requirements if not try Asia. They will of course dodge salary questions with the tried and true 'well I hire for x amount of countries so don't have that exact information right now' but in my experience they offer a range at least.   
</p>

<p>
If you have been vouched for, which is very common in the finance world, then you skip the second phone interview and come in for a casual meeting usually about whatever you previously built and they may ask you about details of the language you claim to be an expert in but mostly it will be just a friendly conversation. Any jargon you use they will ask you to define on the spot to catch you bluffing. If for whatever reasons you're asked to write code it will be to <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/atoi/">implement atoi</a> which is the new fizzbuzz filter everyone has adopted and tests how careless of a developer you are meaning you don't ask any questions about requirements and start writing code immediately. We were told if we were to personally vouch and refer candidates for an interview then our friends we vouched for could expect this friendly style of interview where basically they are trying to lure them from competitors. There's of a course a major catch. If we refer someone and they fail miserably meaning we are careless with referals just handing them out to anyone then we have to cover the cost of the interview which is thousands of dollars. That's what I meant earlier by saying you won't find legit referals anywhere handed out to strangers.   
</p>

<p>
If not vouched for expect the second zoom/phone call to be a typical algorithm style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg">interview</a>. Code correctness and caution is heavily favored over adding complexity to squeeze out some meaningless optimization of constant factors. As a personal anecdote these interview tasks are often designed as a trap to once again see how careless of a developer you are the problems I've seen have an obvious area of optimization to take that will open a potential bug or performance sink elsewhere if you aren't taking your time thinking through the whole original problem space. Prime example they will try and get you with is <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/">cache invalidation</a>. Hiring someone is an investment it will typically take 3 months for them to be productive and if you're being paid $200k/yr that's $50k they have spent hoping you will turn out to be a good hire so now you know why there is all these hoops to jump through.

<div id="outline-container-orgd2f1f13" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd2f1f13">Find a mentor</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd2f1f13">
<p>
Once you are in and develop a routine walk over to the department where all the money is being made and find a mentor to teach you by asking them to give you the work they don't like doing because you want to learn it all from scratch. All you have to do is be the reliable person they turn to whenever some (tedious at first) work needs to be done and if this work over time becomes increasingly more skilled then you have found the right mentor and you are set for life because they will eventually want you to work with them once you have proven to be indispensible. If they get promoted you get promoted, if they go off and start a new company you are the first hire. This can be tricky because of signing multiple NDAs even between internal departments but if you are serious about wanting to learn they will tell management to make it happen. I actually took all the above advice from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOdTSqvQKF0">comedian</a> many years ago and my life would not be the same if I hadn't watched that throwaway clip at 3am because I always assumed there was no way I could ever do this kind of work.

<p>
If you're not interested in finance there are a few companies that mentor developers sometimes even <a href="https://simonsarris.com/p/growing-software-developers">direct</a> from local high schools and build them to senior developers. One is in New Hampshire called <a href="https://nwoods.com/careers.html">Northwoods Software</a>. If you live in Egypt, Georgia, North Macedonia, Albania, Latvia, or Bosnia you can work remotely for <a href="https://scandiweb.com/dev-tech-departement">Scandiweb</a> (Latvia). The pay is only 500-600 Euros per month but you don't know anything yet so are being paid for direct mentorship to become a senior developer.

MIT has a course <a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/">6.1040 Software Design</a> and the professor of that course wrote a <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i>. This is how you design software on a piece of paper from beginning to end so when it comes time to actually code the app it essentially writes itself meaning you could try and use co-pilot or Chat-GPT to generate all the features though that would probably take longer screwing around with prompts than just coding it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOhtH3lugk&amp;list=PLY_nsiUEgM3nbxcO3_ONmKL-ZRhLKpfGV">YouTube video</a> from an AI talk at MIT where the professor of this course further explains what a concept is using the same HN example and how you would use them to get an LLM to develop an entire web app. In their experiment they had to use 'a few hundred' prompts which then becomes your version history and I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to refactor a few hundred prompts but they made it easier with concepts. Languages like Standard ML/OCaml would make writing concepts simple as interfaces for a module.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://61040-fa23.github.io/assets/lecture-notes/L3.pdf">Diverge/Converge</a> describes designing a small app completely. Page 8 check out his riffle.systems idea where a 'reactive database' is used to declaratively write entire websites even generating the DOM elements thus totally replacing how modern webdev is done. I got stuck here and never left after reading these slides and have been toying with a prototype. Really all a web framework does is control changing state and we've already learned how to best control state it's called a database management system. If you want to build a prototype as well take the rest of this workshop! We cover both relational databases from scratch and a programming language book to write your own declarative language as recommended by the authors of the paper.</li>

<p>
In the tutorial for <a href="https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/divergent-tactics/">divergent design</a> he used Chat-GPT to suggest additional features.

There are more slides and recorded lectures <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a> about UIX design if you're interested but we got what we came for. Brainstorm ideas, converge them into separate interfaces on a piece of paper like they are independent microservices. Write out a dependency diagram by going back to the slides when designing your own app and looking at what they did. Go by the criteria: A 'uses' B only if A is simpler because it uses B and B is simpler because it doesn't need A. There is no useful subset containing A but not B. That means a legit dependency. Wait until you get paid to do this somewhere! Everyone breaks the above advice you have countless needless dependencies that make your life hell.

<h3 id="orge012b94">Version control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge012b94">
<p>
The prof of this course with a grad student created <a href="https://gitless.com/#research">gitless.com</a> see <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/projects/conceptual/">this</a> research page on MIT's software design group. Read how they audited the conceptual design of Git and found things like staging were confusing. 
</p>

<p>
Many companies today use a customized Mercurial fork or rewritten clone instead of git like Meta's rust written EdenFS and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/sapling">Sapling SCM</a> because git was originally developed to take advantage of linux file system optimizations ergo is conceptually attached to that file system while Mercurial can be easily adapted to be stuffed in a database, distributed or run on any OS. In a Mercurial style of version control, you probably don't care about individual commits so you don't even add comments to commits you instead care about entire branch development. 
</p>

<p>
For these reasons I don't think you should bother to use git at all unless someone is forcing you or fork gitless and maintain it yourself. Look up how easy and simple the Mercurial guide is for a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/guide#lone_developer">lone developer</a> why use anything else. If you must then try MIT's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/">version control</a> lecture from it's <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">course</a> <i>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</i> or read 'Git for Hackers' floating around. Git is literally some junk Torvalds invented because he couldn't handle CVS. Open source development outside of FOSS you generally fork the project to your account on Github, commit changes there then make a 'Pull Request' or PR to the original repo asking if they will merge your changes. The FOSS way is different using Savannah for example here is a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?10210">patch</a> it's all done in plain text using a traditional mailing list style of attaching files and people vote on it.

<h3 id="org351ffd7">Software freelancing strategies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org351ffd7">
<p>
Who needs software where you live? Restaurants, people cutting hair either out of their house or a shop, people wanting to sell something outside of shopify and all their fees, people wanting to rent their condo public spaces like they all have rooftops or even suites run by the strata that can be rented like AirBnB. Every service needs a booking or quote site such as painters, tailors or power washers or junk haulers. Is there a 'restaurant row' where you live meaning wall to wall bars and restaurants well they all they need staff what about a shift marketplace so freelance wait staff can move around and take extra shifts? There's always something people want and the current offers are largely pure shit if you look around wanting a monthly fee that enormous.
</p>

<p>
My recommendation is to be the local Zapier style developer and stitch together software people actually use instead of inventing an inferior product yourself like everyone else is doing. People are already using business software they prefer like Quickbooks for accounting or Zoho/Salesforce for CRM, or iCal/Google calendar for bookings. You now sew that all together into a product that only needs to be paid for once not a monthly fee. This is a money windfall because now you are the person they call when they want something custom and being 'the Zapier glue and stitch dev' you are exactly the kind of problem solving person they want. Now you are networked with real life businesses and that's the game. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9a1b480" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9a1b480">Starting out</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9a1b480">
<p>
One way is use Upwork projects and Fiver and whatever else you can find that allows you to sell a finished product. Now max abstract all these businesses using exactly what we just learned in conceptual design because what is the difference in technology needed for a local biz like a landscaper, tailor, dog walker, or any other service? Nothing they all take bookings and offer quotes. They need a web form where you upload pics or maybe a login scheme where prior customers who are already known can be assigned a rate and just book directly. Where does all this data need to go? iCal, CRM software API integration, credit card gateway like Stripe, put all that together and advertise it on Upwork but let people know you can do any custom work for $200/day to change the payment gateway to whatever they want. Then keep increasing your rates (see below). Now you're the Zapier d00d just gluing together stuff. Hell I would pay you for this myself I never have time anymore and would kill for a Zapier-like stitcher freelancer to simply combine a bunch of things I use without me having to do it myself and most importantly where I don't need to pay a monthly fee. tl;dr Everyone wants this they just don't know anybody who does it or where to find them.
</p>

<p>
As an experiment because I'm a bit of a gonzo journalist that just <a href="http://www.infiltration.org/">infiltrates</a> everything I can I went to every meet I could book in my city for a single week, I even bought a membership at the fancy social club here which is largely real estate developers and various startup CEOs and diamond dealers. Just wandering around socializing I got dozens of leads and if I was a software mercenary I would have picked up a lot of work. Unfortunately I'm not a software merc but kind of thinking about it now that I've seen how easy it is. I never told anyone where I worked and software always came up anyway in conversations and everyone, <i>everyone</i>, wants to deal with someone they have actually met in person. 
</p>

<p>
I also called people out of the blue from LinkedIn from various local companies and just told them hey I'm trying to find out about your work tell me everything about it and they did. I even met 3 of them for lunch which I paid for and was immediately given leads I'm honestly surprised how easy this is to do making me think I chose the wrong career I should quit and just be the guy who can make anything happen with software.

<div id="outline-container-org7cc6cf2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7cc6cf2">Rates</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7cc6cf2">
<p>
You always bill daily not hourly. You always increase your rates if you have so many clients you can't accomodate them all then you're not charging enough of a daily rate. Sites like Upwork or whatever other freelancer job boards that are review based you have to bite the bullet and offer yourself for scraps at first just to get some kind of reputation then from there can charge whatever you want. Once I had rep I changed my rate to something ridiculous and get offers sent to me because I am offering to do the kind of optimization we will learn in the Andy Pavlo CMU course after this.

<div id="outline-container-org98a698f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org98a698f">Agencies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org98a698f">
<p>
Search for agencies and you will <a href="https://www.charleagency.com/">find</a> many of them. Agencies are often never hiring because they find people to work there by approaching the best in the business and asking them to join the agency. This is how architect agencies work, ad agencies, etc. Make an example site template if it's Shopify or full site demo of your skills and ask them to send you work to do for free because you want to learn. They will if your demo is impressive. They will hire you F/T too if the work you return is good. Most of ecommerce is still just Shopify and WooCommerce somehow. You may scoff of this but I did it after doing manual labor everyday and the feedback was priceless it was free mentorship/school. They eventually started paying me when one of their agency freelancers became flakey and that experience plus what I learned here led to me getting a paid position at a university research lab which was also something you cannot assign a price to because they gave me a letter of recommendation. If a professor personally vouches for you then the rest of your life is easy mode you can even screw up interviews and they won't care because there's a piece of paper assuring that you are worth working.

<div id="outline-container-org87d814c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org87d814c">Kick the door down in an existing market and take everything</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org87d814c">
<p>
Another way I started out and still operate is I will go on software marketplaces like Shopify or wherever business app marketplace where software is sold and I read all the reviews to find out what paying customers hate about the product. I actually make a list of these complaints and then clone that software and incorporate all the features and fixes then contact those customers directly. I can do this because I'm using OCaml (in the past Lisp) and you write very little code like adding dozens of new checkout options is just a functor over a checkout module but my problem is I'm a one man show so I can't do 24/7 support like some of them offer but many times just adding the features and talking to customers directly led to success. I was banned for doing this because I was too young and did it way too aggressively but definitely find software people pay for you think you can clone yourself and see what the problems are. Adding forms to Shopify pages is a major issue nobody has fixed you could kick down that door and take everyone's money look at the reviews they're all awful. 
</p>

<p>
My recommendation is clone something and hand out your phone number to everyone and tell them to call you. In the past I was like no way would I do that but after my infiltration into the sales world I'm so surprised how easy it is anything I do in the future I'm definitely asking the punters to phone me and tell me everything you want, I will implement it for free if you buy a subscription. Which of course is what ycombinator recommends and is the topic of the next section.

<div id="outline-container-org99b3ba1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org99b3ba1">Making a startup</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org99b3ba1">
<p>
A real startup requires venture capital. Here's Peter Thiel giving a very good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k">crash course</a> in making a startup to Stanford students. Everything he says is true whatever market you are targeting you should be expecting to take that entire market or nobody will invest. Start small and monopolize something small. 
</p>

<p>
Of course how do you monopolize? I researched the Ycombinator startup school so you don't have to. They tell you as a founder everyday you are only talking to customers. If you have 5 customers you talk to them everyday and ask them about their needs. If you have 50 you talk to them everyday. If you have no customers you phone everyone you can in your business and find out what they want and pass these features to your team of wagies and have them implement it. That is literally it there's no other magic or anything it's just talk to absolutely everybody who is paying for your service or may pay for it and build growth by listening to them and making a product that others will want because you listened. Here's an old article of Sam Altman of Open AI (now a monopoly too) talking about how Ycombinator's success is due to it being &#x2026; a <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/sam-altman-yc-monopoly.html">monopoly</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Freelancing is of course different, you can get into the restaurant marketplace and carve a little niche but a startup is very different it's about going public with an initial public offering and cashing out all your shares once someone buys you. Who buys software companies? Salesforce. They are the most aggressive company right now buying up everyone if you have a vector dbms prototype they may buy it. Facebook or Meta or w/e their name is right now is still aggressive buying everyone. 
</p>

<p>
To make a startup you have to present to investors and convince them that by giving you money they will get a windfall of cash down the road when it goes public or gets sold to Salesforce or Meta. This isn't impossible but it is like advanced bamboozling beyond my skills. I'm just a clownish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U58lSO_bR8">street</a> guy and even I had success so I imagine the bar is not high for this.

<p>
<b>I am rewriting all of this with a USACO champion next week</b> 
</p>

<p>
I'm going to do all the USACO contest problems using inquiry-based learning because that's exactly what you do in real life. If you took <a href="./accelerated.html">Accelerated Intro to CS</a> you have already seen almost every topic in the USACO guide and if you didn't it doesn't matter that's why there exists a guide which we can look at while we solve a problem, so you learn the algorithm as you are using it. 
</p>


<p>
<b>Real competitive programming</b>
</p>

<p>
Here is Gennady Korotkevich aka tourist <a href="https://youtu.be/97tieEKfvBs">practicing</a> on codeforces and explaining what he's doing, though he didn't start with C++ he used to win the IOI with Pascal in high school then switched later. The first thing to notice is he's using a basic text editor and minimalist shell that looks like MinGW a Windows port of GCC and <a href="https://www.farmanager.com/screenshots.php?l=en">Far Manager</a> where he manually submits through the codeforces website UI. He prepares individual directories named after the problem then always makes a sol.cpp file in that directory so he doesn't have to change a macro he's written to compile the solution from the shell.
</p>

<p>
His C++ template:
</p>
<pre class="example">
// include every C++ std library and bits library
// doesn't work on all platforms
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

// use std namespace to avoid having to write std::cin or std::cout
// in other words bringing into scope all C++ std libraries 
using namespace std;

int main() {
// turn off default cout flush 
 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
 cin.tie(0)
</pre>

<p>
std::cin is synchronized to std::cout and performs default buffer flushing operations so to save some runtime he disables this sync. His compiler flags he explains in one of these recorded streams, most of them are to make compiler messages extra verbose for debugging. Note you would never write software outside of competitive programming like this because he has opened a gigantic scope.  
</p>

<p>
You don't have to watch the entire 2hr vid, the last problem seems like the most informative. He begins most problems by writing examples as comments. He copies the problem input test cases into a text file 'in1' then pipes it into his compiled program "sol.exe &lt; in1" from the shell as stdin (standard input). He writes multiple submissions to compare their runtime/memory usage. He looks for some kind of mathematical structure in the formulas given in the problem write-up. After a submission he reviews the solutions others did and compares them to his own but note he solved the problems first, he didn't give up and go straight to the solution.    
</p>

<p>
A TLE or time limit exceeded verdict shows how he would optimize to get accepted verdict also trolling the stream by making all the variable names into single letters claiming it will speed up the program. The judging server ran his program faster than his laptop, something to remember.

<div id="outline-container-org19d3f51" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org19d3f51">Big-O explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org19d3f51">
<p>
The USACO guide has a good introduction to big-O and a resource we can use where running time is actually explained is the beginning chapters of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#%28part._.Order_notation_and_its_discontents%29">Functional Data Structures</a> by Prof Ragde at Waterloo try reading the first few chapters up to 2.2.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is:
</p>

<p>
\(f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)\) for all inputs \(x \ge x_0\) as x (inputs) goes to infinity. If that inequality holds then f(x) is in O(g(x)) which represents a worse-case scenario upper bound. A 'best-case' (wishful thinking) scenario for insertion sort is you don't have to do anything but attach the element to the already sorted list and the worst-case is the entire list is in reverse order and every element looked at and moved.  
</p>

<p>
<b>f() function</b> is a cost function of time or resources derived from a cost model. It's where you count up every constant operation and loop costs by analyzing source. This is not always easy since what costs do you assign when the code triggers garbage collection or triggers memory allocation because an object has been created deep in some library code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The g() function</b> is chosen from a list of math functions that represent a 'family of functions'. A family means all functions that are linear, all functions that are quadratic, all functions that are linearithmic etc. It actually is a specific list as we'll soon see. 
</p>

<p>
Why are constants hidden in big-O? If you read SICP their example is 16 and 8 both differ by a factor of 2 and 8 but we don't care which factor. In real life the constant factors do matter if they are hiding a lot of operations. A classic example of this is when Knuth was writing the Stanford GraphBase (contents are in Vol 4A of TAOCP) and his real-world testing of popular graph algorithms found that 'Fibonacci heaps' that were analyzed using a technique called amortized analysis weren't any better than Kruskal's old algorithm because the analysis was hiding large constant operations. One way to reduce constants is to do consecutive rounds of a linear algorithm such as cleaning up a graph removing cycles because O(n + n) or O(2n) is still O(n). 
</p>

<p>
Big-O doesn't represent growth since if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> it does not grow to be quadratic, f(x) already is quadratic, thus f() is in \(O(n^{2})\) or upper bounded by every quadratic function. Typically in algorithm analysis the inputs are supposed to be 'near infinite' which is why n is used instead of x in f(n) to signal the difference in inputs but here in the USACO guide we can see that if the input is small then we can get away with some very bad runtimes even exponential.

He tells us most decision problems can't be solved by an algorithm which ruins the AI superintelligence dystopia. When he translates Super Mario Bros to a 3SAT decision problem we can see that almost every algorithm you can think of can be transformed to a decision problem. You don't have to keep watching this but there's an interesting intro to constraint logic/graphs. Now you can explain to someone P=NP means all the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms that always 'lucky guess' correctly or have a magic oracle can be solved by an algorithm in deterministic polynomial time which seems impossible.

The rest of this course I won't do here but the book he wrote that goes with the lectures looks excellent covering topics in economics too.

If you look at the archived <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results">contests</a> we are given all the test inputs/outputs as a .zip and a fully worked out solution with a proof of the bounds. This means <i>you can use any language you want</i> however I am going to do it all in C++ with Knuth's literate programming tool cweb because it mimics exactly how you would build something in a collaborative setting and after using it for a few problems it's kind of awesome and I finally get why Knuth shills this style of programming so much.
